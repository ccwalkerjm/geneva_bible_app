With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured vnto you: and vnto you that heare, shall more be giuen.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For vnto him that hath, shall it be giuen, and from him that hath not, shall be taken away, euen that he hath.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Also he said, So is the kingdome of God, as if a man should cast seede in the ground,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And shoulde sleepe, and rise vp night and day, and the seede should spring and growe vp, he not knowing howe.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For the earth bringeth foorth fruite of it selfe, first the blade, then the eares, after that full corne in the eares.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And assoone as the fruite sheweth it selfe, anon hee putteth in the sickle, because the haruest is come.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He saide moreouer, Whereunto shall wee liken the kingdome of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It is like a graine of mustarde seede, which when it is sowen in the earth, is the least of all seedes that be in the earth:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But after that it is sowen, it groweth vp, and is greatest of all herbes, and beareth great branches, so that the foules of heauen may builde vnder the shadow of it.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And with many such parables he preached the word vnto them, as they were able to heare it.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And without parables spake hee nothing vnto them: but he expounded all thinges to his disciples apart.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Nowe the same day when euen was come, he saide vnto them, Let vs passe ouer vnto the other side.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they left the multitude, and tooke him as he was in the shippe, and there were also with him other little shippes.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And there arose a great storme of winde, and the waues dashed into the shippe, so that it was now full.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he was in the sterne asleepe on a pillow: and they awoke him, and saide to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And hee rose vp, and rebuked the winde, and saide vnto the sea, Peace, and be still. So the winde ceased, and it was a great calme.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then he saide vnto them, Why are ye so fearefull? how is it that ye haue no faith?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who is this, that both the winde and sea obey him? </div><ul class='tnav'>
