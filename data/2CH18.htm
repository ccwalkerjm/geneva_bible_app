<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Iehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, but he was ioyned in affinitie with Ahab.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And after certaine yeeres he went downe to Ahab to Samaria: and Ahab slew sheepe and oxen for him in great nomber, and for the people that he had with him, and entised him to goe vp vnto Ramoth Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Ahab King of Israel saide vnto Iehoshaphat King of Iudah, Wilt thou goe with mee to Ramoth Gilead? And hee answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people, and wee will ioyne with thee in the warre.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Iehoshaphat sayde vnto the King of Israel, Aske counsel, I pray thee, at the worde of the Lord this day.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Therefore the King of Israel gathered of Prophets foure hundreth men, and sayde vnto them, Shall we goe to Ramoth Gilead to battel, or shall I cease? And they sayd, Go vp: for God shall deliuer it into the Kings hand.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Iehoshaphat sayde, Is there heere neuer a Prophet more of the Lord that wee might inquire of him?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the King of Israel sayd vnto Iehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whome wee may aske counsell of the Lord, but I hate him: for he doeth not prophesie good vnto me, but alway euil: it is Michaiah the sonne of Imla. Then Iehoshaphat said, Let not the King say so.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the King of Israel called an eunuche, and said, Call quickly Michaiah the sonne of Imla.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the King of Israel, and Iehoshaphat King of Iudah sate either of them on his throne clothed in their apparel: they sate euen in the threshing floore at the entring in of the gate of Samaria: and all the Prophets prophesied before them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Zidkiah ye sonne of Chenaanah made him hornes of yron, and sayde, Thus sayth the Lord, With these shalt thou push the Aramites vntill thou hast consumed them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all the Prophets prophesied so, saying, Go vp to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliuer it into the hand of the King.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the messenger that went to call Michaiah, spake to him, saying, Beholde, the wordes of the Prophets declare good to the King with one accord: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speake thou good.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Michaiah saide, As the Lord liueth, whatsoeuer my God saith, that will I speake.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So he came to the King, and the King said vnto him, Michaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battel, or shall I leaue off? And he said, Goe yee vp, and prosper, and they shalbe deliuered into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the King sayd to him, Howe oft shall I charge thee, that thou tell mee nothing but the trueth in the Name of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then he said, I saw al Israel scattered in the mountaines, as sheepe that haue no shepheard: and the Lord sayd, These haue no Master: let them returne euery man to his house in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the King of Israel sayde to Iehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee, that he would not prophesie good vnto me, but euill?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Againe hee saide, Therefore heare ye the worde of the Lord: I sawe the Lord sit vpon his throne, and all the hoste of heauen standing at his right hand, and at his left.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord sayd, Who shall perswade Ahab King of Israel, that he may go vp, and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And one spake and said thus, and another said that.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then there came forth a spirit and stoode before the Lord, and said, I will perswade him. And the Lord said vnto him, Wherein?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he saide, I will goe out, and bee a false spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets. And hee said, Thou shalt perswade, and shalt also preuaile: goe forth and do so.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now therefore behold, the Lord hath put a false spirit in the mouth of these thy Prophets, and the Lord hath determined euill against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Zidkiah the sonne of Chenaanah came neere, and smote Michaiah vpon the cheeke, and sayde, By what way went the Spirit of the Lord from me, to speake with thee?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Michaiah saide, Behold, thou shalt see that day when thou shalt goe from chamber to chamber to hide thee.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the King of Israel sayde, Take ye Michaiah, and cary him to Amon the gouernour of the citie, and to Ioash the Kings sonne,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And say, Thus saith the King, Put this man in the prison house, and feede him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction vntil I returne in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Michaiah said, If thou returne in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me. And he saide, Heare, all ye people.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So the King of Israel and Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah went vp to Ramoth Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the King of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat, I will change my selfe, and enter into the battel: but put thou on thine apparel. So the King of Israel changed himselfe, and they went into the battel.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the King of Aram had commanded the captaines of the charets that were with him, saying, Fight you not with small, nor great, but against the King of Israel onely.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when the captaines of the charets saw Iehoshaphat, they sayde, It is the King of Israel: and they compassed about him to fight. But Iehoshaphat cryed, and the Lord helped him and moued them to depart from him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For when the captaines of the charets saw that hee was not the King of Israel, they turned backe from him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then a certaine man drewe a bowe mightily, and smote the King of Israel betweene the ioyntes of his brigandine: Therefore he saide to his charetman, Turne thine hand, and carie mee out of the host: for I am hurt.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the battel increased that day: and the King of Israel stood still in his charet against the Aramites vntil euen, and dyed at the time of the sunne going downe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
