I raysed thee vp vnder an apple tree: there thy mother conceiued thee: there she coceiued that bare thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Set mee as a seale on thine heart, and as a signet vpon thine arme: for loue is strong as death: ielousie is cruel as the graue: the coles thereof are fierie coles, and a vehement flame.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Much water can not quench loue, neither can the floods drowne it: If a man should giue all the substance of his house for loue, they would greatly contemne it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Wee haue a litle sister, and she hath no breastes: what shall we do for our sister when she shalbe spoken for?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If shee be a wall, we will builde vpon her a siluer palace: and if she be a doore, we wil keepe her in with bordes of cedar.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am a wall, and my breasts are as towres: then was I in his eyes as one that findeth peace.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Salomon had a vine in Baal-hamon: hee gaue the vineyarde vnto keepers: euery one bringeth for ye fruite thereof a thousand pieces of siluer.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But my vineyarde which is mine, is before me: to thee, O Salomon appertaineth a thousand pieces of siluer, and two hundreth to them that keepe the fruite thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken vnto thy voyce: cause me to heare it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>O my welbeloued, flee away, and be like vnto the roe, or to the yong harte vpon ye mountaines of spices. </div><ul class='tnav'>
