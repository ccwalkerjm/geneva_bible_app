And another, Is it I?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he answered and sayde vnto them, It is one of the twelue that dippeth with mee in the platter.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Truely the Sonne of man goeth his way, as it is written of him: but woe bee to that man, by whome the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had beene good for that man, if hee had neuer beene borne.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And as they did eate, Iesus tooke the bread, and when hee had giuen thankes, he brake it and gaue it to them, and sayde, Take, eate, this is my bodie.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Also he tooke the cuppe, and when he had giuen thankes, gaue it to them: and they all dranke of it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he saide vnto them, This is my blood of that newe Testament, which is shed for many.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto you, I wil drinke no more of the fruit of ye vine vntill that day, that I drinke it newe in the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when they had sung a Psalme, they went out to the mount of Oliues.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Iesus said vnto them, Al ye shall be offended by mee this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepheard, and the sheepe shall be scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But after that I am risen, I will goe into Galile before you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Peter saide vnto him, Although all men should be offended at thee, yet would not I.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Iesus saide vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, this day, euen in this night, before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt denie me thrise.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But he saide more earnestly. If I shoulde die with thee, I will not denie thee: likewise also saide they all.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>After, they came into a place named Gethsemane: then hee saide to his disciples, Sit yee here, till I haue praied.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And hee tooke with him Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and hee began to be troubled, and in great heauinesse,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And saide vnto them, My soule is very heauie, euen vnto the death: tarie here, and watch.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So he went forward a litle, and fell downe on the ground, and praied, that if it were possible, that houre might passe from him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he saide, Abba, Father, all things are possible vnto thee: take away this cup from me: neuertheles not that I will, but that thou wilt, be done.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then hee came, and founde them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watche one houre?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Watch ye, and pray, that ye enter not into tentation: the spirite in deede is ready, but the flesh is weake.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And againe hee went away, and praied, and spake the same wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he returned, and founde them a sleepe againe: for their eyes were heauie: neither knewe they what they should answere him.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he came the third time, and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth, and take your rest: it is ynough: the houre is come: beholde, the Sonne of man is deliuered into the hands of sinners.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Rise vp: let vs go: loe, he that betraieth me, is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And immediatly while hee yet spake, came Iudas that was one of the twelue, and with him a great multitude with swordes and staues from the hie Priests, and Scribes, and Elders.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he that betraied him, had giuen them a token, saying, Whomsoeuer I shall kisse, he it is: take him and leade him away safely.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And assoone as hee was come, hee went straightway to him, and saide, Haile Master, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then they laide their handes on him, and tooke him.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And one of them that stoode by, drewe out a sword, and smote a seruant of the hie Priest, and cut off his eare.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And Iesus answered and saide to them, Ye be come out as against a thiefe with swordes, and with staues, to take me.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>I was daily with you teaching in the Temple, and yee tooke me not: but this is done that the Scriptures should be fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then they all forsooke him, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And there followed him a certaine yong man, clothed in linnen vpon his bare bodie, and the yong men caught him.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>But he left his linnen cloth, and fled from them naked.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>So they led Iesus away to the hie Priest, and to him came together all the hie Priestes, and the Elders, and the Scribes.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And Peter folowed him afarre off, euen into the hall of the hie Priest, and sate with the seruants, and warmed himselfe at the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And the hie Priests, and all the Councill sought for witnesse against Iesus, to put him to death, but found none.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>For many bare false witnesse against him, but their witnesse agreed not together.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Then there arose certaine, and bare false witnesse against him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>We hearde him say, I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and within three daies I will builde another, made without hands.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>But their witnesse yet agreed not together.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Then the hie Priest stoode vp amongst them, and asked Iesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is the matter that these beare witnesse against thee?  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>But hee helde his peace, and answered nothing. Againe the hie Priest asked him, and sayde vnto him, Art thou that Christ the Sonne of the Blessed?  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And Iesus said, I am he, and yee shall see the Sonne of man sitte at the right hande of the power of God, and come in the clouds of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Then the hie Priest rent his clothes, and sayd, What haue we any more neede of witnesses?  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Ye haue heard the blasphemie: what thinke yee? And they all condemned him to be worthie of death.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And some began to spit at him, and to couer his face, and to beate him with fists, and to say vnto him, Prophesie. And the sergeants smote him with their roddes.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And as Peter was beneath in the hal, there came one of the maides of the hie Priest.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>And when shee sawe Peter warming him selfe, shee looked on him, and sayde, Thou wast also with Iesus of Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>But he denied it, saying, I knowe him not, neither wot I what thou saiest. Then he went out into the porche, and the cocke crewe.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>Then a maid sawe him againe, and bega to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>But hee denied it againe: and anon after, they that stoode by, sayde againe to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art of Galile, and thy speach is like.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>And he began to curse, and sweare, saying, I knowe not this man of whom ye speake.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>Then the seconde time the cocke crewe, and Peter remembred the woorde that Iesus had saide vnto him, Before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt denie me thrise, and waying that with himselfe, he wept. </div><ul class='tnav'>
