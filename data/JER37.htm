And Ieremiah sayd, Yea: for, sayd he, thou shalt be deliuered into the hand of the King of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Moreouer, Ieremiah sayd vnto King Zedekiah, What haue I offended against thee, or against thy seruants, or against this people, that ye haue put me in prison?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Where are nowe your prophets, which prophecied vnto you, saying, The King of Babel shall not come against you, nor against this land?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore heare nowe, I pray thee, O my lorde the King: let my prayer be accepted before thee, that thou cause mee not to returne to the house of Iehonathan the scribe, least I die there.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Zedekiah the King commanded, that they should put Ieremiah in the court of the prison, and that they should giue him dayly a piece of bread out of the bakers streete vntill all the bread in the citie were eaten vp. Thus Ieremiah remained in the court of the prison. </div><ul class='tnav'>
