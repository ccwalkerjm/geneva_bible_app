 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Girde vp nowe thy loynes like a man: I will demande of thee and declare thou vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Where wast thou when I layd the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast vnderstanding,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who hath layde the measures thereof, if thou knowest, or who hath stretched the line ouer it:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Whereupon are the foundations thereof set: or who layed the corner stone thereof:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When the starres of the morning praysed me together, and all the children of God reioyced:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Or who hath shut vp the Sea with doores, when it yssued and came foorth as out of the wombe:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When I made the cloudes as a couering thereof, and darkenesse as the swadeling bands thereof:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When I stablished my commandement vpon it, and set barres and doores,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no farther, and here shall it stay thy proude waues.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hast thou commanded the morning since thy dayes? hast thou caused the morning to knowe his place,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>That it might take hold of the corners of the earth, and that the wicked might be shaken out of it?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>It is turned as clay to facion, and all stand vp as a garment.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And from the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the hie arme shalbe broken.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Hast thou entred into the bottomes of the sea? or hast thou walked to seeke out the depth?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Haue the gates of death bene opened vnto thee? or hast thou seene the gates of the shadowe of death?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hast thou perceiued the breadth of the earth? tell if thou knowest all this.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Where is the way where light dwelleth? and where is the place of darkenesse,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>That thou shouldest receiue it in the boundes thereof, and that thou shouldest knowe the paths to the house thereof?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Knewest thou it, because thou wast then borne, and because the nomber of thy dayes is great?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Hast thou entred into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seene the treasures of ye haile,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Which I haue hid against the time of trouble, against the day of warre and battell?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the East winde vpon the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Who hath deuided the spowtes for the raine? or the way for the lightning of ye thunders,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>To cause it to raine on the earth where no man is, and in the wildernes where there is no man?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>To fulfil the wilde and waste place, and to cause the bud of the herbe to spring forth?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Who is the father of the rayne? or who hath begotten the droppes of the dewe?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Out of whose wombe came the yee? who hath ingendred the frost of the heauen?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The waters are hid as with a stone: and the face of the depth is frosen.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Canst thou restraine the sweete influences of the Pleiades? or loose the bandes of Orion?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Canst thou bring foorth Mazzaroth in their time? canst thou also guide Arcturus with his sonnes?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Knowest thou the course of heauen, or canst thou set the rule thereof in the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Canst thou lift vp thy voice to the cloudes that the aboundance of water may couer thee?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Canst thou sende the lightenings that they may walke, and say vnto thee, Loe, heere we are?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Who hath put wisedome in the reines? or who hath giuen the heart vnderstanding?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Who can nomber cloudes by wisedome? or who can cause to cease the bottels of heaue,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>When the earth groweth into hardnesse, and the clottes are fast together? </div><ul class='tnav'>
