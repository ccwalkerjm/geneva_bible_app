And the Lord said, Iudah shalbe first.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then the children of Israel arose vp earely and camped against Gibeah.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the men of Israel went out to battell against Beniamin, and the men of Israel put themselues in aray to fight against the beside Gibeah.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the children of Beniamin came out of Gibeah, and slewe downe to the ground of the Israelites that day two and twentie thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the people, the men of Israel plucked vp their hearts, and set their battel againe in aray in the place where they put them in aray the first day.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>(For the children of Israel had gone vp and wept before the Lord vnto the euening, and had asked of the Lord, saying, Shall I goe againe to battel against the children of Beniamin my brethren? and the Lord said, Go vp against them)  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the children of Israel came neere against the children of Beniamin the second day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Also the second day Beniamin came forth to meete them out of Gibeah, and slewe downe to the grounde of the children of Israel againe eighteene thousand men: all they could handle the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then al the children of Israel went vp and all the people came also vnto the house of God, and wept and sate there before the Lord and fasted that day vnto the euening, and offred burnt offrings and peace offrings before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the children of Israel asked the Lord (for there was the Arke of the couenat of God in those dayes,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar, the sonne of Aaron stoode before it at that time) saying, Shall I yet goe anie more to battel against the children of Beniamin my brethren, or shall I cease? And the Lord said, Go vp: for to morowe I will deliuer them into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Israel set men to lie in waite round about Gibeah.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the children of Israel went vp against the children of Beniamin the third day, and put theselues in aray against Gibeah, as at other times.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then the children of Beniamin comming out against the people, were drawen from the citie: and they began to smite of ye people and kill as at other times, euen by the wayes in the fielde (whereof one goeth vp to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah) vpon a thirtie men of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>(For the children of Beniamin sayd, They are fallen before vs, as at the first. But the children of Israel saide, Let vs flee and plucke them away from the citie vnto the hie wayes)  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And all the men of Israel rose vp out of their place, and put themselues in aray at Baal-tamar: and the men that lay in wayte of the Israelites came forth of their place, euen out of the medowes of Gibeah,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they came ouer against Gibeah, ten thousande chosen men of all Israel, and the battell was sore: for they knewe not that the euill was neere them.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Lord smote Beniamin before Israel, and the children of Israel destroyed of the Beniamites the same day fiue and twenty thousand and an hundreth men: all they could handle the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So the children of Beniamin sawe that they were striken downe: for the men of Israel gaue place to the Beniamites, because they trusted to the men that lay in waite, which they had laide beside Gibeah.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they that lay in wait hasted, and brake forth toward Gibeah, and the ambushment drewe themselues along, and smote all the citie with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Also the men of Israel had appoynted a certaine time with the ambushmentes, that they should make a great flame and smoke rise vp out of the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And when the men of Israel retired in the battel, Beniamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirtie persons: for they said, Surely they are striken downe before vs, as in the first battell.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But when the flame bega to arise out of the citie, as a pillar of smoke, the Beniamites looked backe, and behold, the flame of the citie began to ascend vp to heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then the men of Israel turned againe, and the men of Beniamin were astonied: for they saw that euill was neere vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Therefore they fled before the men of Israel vnto the way of the wildernesse, but the battell ouertooke them: also they which came out of the cities, slew them among them.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Thus they compassed the Beniamites about, and chased them at ease, and ouerranne them, euen ouer against Gibeah on the Eastside.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And there were slaine of Beniamin eyghteene thousad men, which were all men of warre.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And they turned and fled to the wildernes vnto the rocke of Rimmon: and the Israelites glayned of them by the way fiue thousand men, and pursued after them vnto Gidom, and slewe two thousand men of them,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>So that all that were slayne that day of Beniamin, were fiue and twentie thousand men that drewe sword, which were all men of warre:  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>But sixe hundreth men turned and fled to the wildernesse vnto the rocke of Rimmon, and abode in the rocke of Rimmon foure moneths.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Then the men of Israel returned vnto the children of Beniamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword from the men of the citie vnto the beasts, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they coulde come by. </div><ul class='tnav'>
