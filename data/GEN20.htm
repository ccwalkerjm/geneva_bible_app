Then Abimelech King of Gerar sent and tooke Sarah.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But God came to Abimelech in a dreame by night, and said to him, Beholde, thou art but dead, because of the woman, which thou hast taken: for she is a mans wife.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>(Notwithstanding Abimelech had not yet come neere her) And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay euen the righteous nation?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Said not he vnto me, She is my sister? yea, and she her selfe said, He is my brother: with an vpright minde, and innocent handes haue I done this.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And God saide vnto him by a dreame, I knowe that thou diddest this euen with an vpright minde, and I kept thee also that thou shouldest not sinne against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touche her.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now then deliuer the man his wife againe: for he is a Prophet, and he shall pray for thee that thou mayest liue: but if thou deliuer her not againe, be sure that thou shalt die the death, thou, and all that thou hast.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Abimelech rising vp early in ye morning, called all his seruants, and tolde all these things vnto them, and the men were sore afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Afterward Abimelech called Abraham, and said vnto him, What hast thou done vnto vs? and what haue I offeded thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdome this great sinne? thou hast done things vnto me that ought not to be done.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What sawest thou that thou hast done this thing?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Abraham answered, Because I thought thus, Surely the feare of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wiues sake.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yet in very deede she is my sister: for she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she is my wife.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Nowe when God caused me to wander out of my fathers house, I said then to her, This is thy kindnes that thou shalt shewe vnto me in all places where we come, Say thou of me, He is my brother.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then tooke Abimelech sheepe and beeues, and men seruants, and women seruants, and gaue them vnto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Abimelech saide, Beholde, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Likewise to Sarah he said, Beholde, I haue giuen thy brother a thousand pieces of siluer: behold, he is the vaile of thine eyes to all that are with thee, and to all others: and she was thus reproued.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Abraham prayed vnto God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his women seruants: and they bare children.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For the Lord had shut vp euery wombe of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abrahams wife. </div><ul class='tnav'>
