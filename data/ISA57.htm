Should I delite in these?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thou hast made thy bed vpon a very hie mountaine: thou wentest vp thither, euen thither wentest thou to offer sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behinde the doores also and postes hast thou set vp thy remembrance: for thou hast discouered thy selfe to another then me, and wentest vp, and diddest enlarge thy bed, and make a couenant betweene thee and them, and louedst their bed in euery place where thou sawest it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou wentest to the Kings with oyle, and diddest increase thine oyntments and sende thy messengers farre off, and diddest humble thy selfe vnto hell.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou weariedst thy selfe in thy manifolde iourneys, yet saydest thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found life by thine hand, therefore thou wast not grieued.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And whome diddest thou reuerence or feare, seeing thou hast lyed vnto me, and hast not remembred me, neither set thy minde thereon? is it not because I holde my peace, and that of long time? therefore thou fearest not me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will declare thy righteousnes and thy workes, and they shall not profite thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When thou cryest, let them that thou hast gathered together deliuer thee: but the winde shall take them all away: vanitie shall pull them away: but he that trusteth in me, shall inherite the lande, and shall possesse mine holy Mountaine.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he shall say, Cast vp, cast vp: prepare the way: take vp the stumbling blocks out of the way of my people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For thus sayth he that is hie and excellent, he that inhabiteth the eternitie, whose Name is the Holy one, I dwell in the high and holy place: with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirite to reuiue the spirite of the humble, and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For I will not contende for euer, neither will I be alwayes wroth, for the spirite should fayle before me: and I haue made the breath.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For his wicked couetousnesse I am angry with him, and haue smitten him: I hid mee and was angry, yet he went away, and turned after the way of his owne heart.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I haue seene his wayes, and wil heale him: I wil leade him also, and restore comfort vnto him, and to those that lament him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I create the fruite of the lips, to be peace: peace vnto them that are farre off, and to them that are neere, sayth the Lord: for I will heale him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the wicked are like the raging sea, that can not rest, whose waters cast vp myre and dirt.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There is no peace, sayth my God, to the wicked. </div><ul class='tnav'>
