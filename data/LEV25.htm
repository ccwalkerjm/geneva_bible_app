<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 25</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the Lord spake vnto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye shall come into the lande which I giue you, the lande shall keepe Sabbath vnto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Sixe yeeres thou shalt sowe thy field, and sixe yeeres thou shalt cut thy vineyarde, and gather the fruite thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But the seuenth yeere shalbe a Sabbath of rest vnto the lande: it shall be the Lordes Sabbath: thou shalt neither sowe thy fielde, nor cut thy vineyarde.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That which groweth of it owne accorde of thy haruest, thou shalt not reape, neither gather the grapes that thou hast left vnlaboured: for it shalbe a yeere of rest vnto the land.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the rest of the lande shall be meate for you, euen for thee, and for thy seruant, and for thy mayde, and for thy hired seruant, and for the stranger that soiourneth with thee:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And for thy cattell, and for the beastes that are in thy lande shall all the encrease thereof be meate.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Also thou shalt number seuen Sabbaths of yeeres vnto thee, euen seuen times seuen yeere: and the space of the seuen Sabbaths of yeeres will be vnto thee nine and fourtie yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then thou shalt cause to blow the trumpet of the Iubile in the tenth day of the seuenth moneth: euen in the day of the reconciliation shall ye make the trumpet blowe, throughout all your lande.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And ye shall halowe that yeere, euen the fiftieth yeere, and proclaime libertie in the lande to all the inhabitants thereof: it shalbe the Iubile vnto you, and ye shall returne euery man vnto his possession, and euery man shall returne vnto his familie.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This fiftieth yeere shalbe a yeere of Iubile vnto you: ye shall not sowe, neither reape that which groweth of it selfe, neither gather the grapes thereof, that are left vnlaboured.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For it is the Iubile, it shall be holy vnto you: ye shall eate of the encrease thereof out of the fielde.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In the yeere of this Iubile, ye shall returne euery man vnto his possession.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when thou sellest ought to thy neighbour, or byest at thy neighbours hande, ye shall not oppresse one another:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But according to the nomber of yeeres after the Iubile thou shalt bye of thy neighbour: also according to the nomber of the yeeres of the reuenues, he shall sell vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>According to the multitude of yeeres, thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewnesse of yeeres, thou shalt abate the price of it: for the nomber of fruites doeth he sell vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Oppresse not ye therefore any man his neighbour, but thou shalt feare thy God: for I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Wherefore ye shall obey mine ordinances, and keepe my lawes, and do them, and ye shall dwell in the land in safetie.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the lande shall giue her fruite, and ye shall eate your fill, and dwell therein in safetie.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And if ye shall say, What shall we eate the seuenth yeere, for we shall not sowe, nor gather in our increase?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I will sende my blessing vpon you in the sixt yeere, and it shall bring foorth fruite for three yeeres.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And ye shall sowe the eight yeere, and eate of the olde fruite vntill the ninth yeere: vntill the fruite thereof come, ye shall eate the olde.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Also the lande shall not be solde to be cut off from the familie: for the land is mine, and ye be but strangers and soiourners with me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore in all the land of your possession ye shall graunt a redemption for the lande.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If thy brother be impouerished, and sell his possession, then his redeemer shall come, euen his neere kinsman, and bye out that which his brother solde.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And if he haue no redeemer, but hath gotten and founde to bye it out,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then shall he count the yeeres of his sale, and restore the ouerplus to the man, to whome he solde it: so shall he returne to his possession.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if he can not get sufficient to restore to him, then that which is solde, shall remaine in the hande of him that hath bought it, vntill the yere of the Iubile: and in the Iubile it shall come out, and he shall returne vnto his possession.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Likewise if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled citie, he may bye it out againe within a whole yeere after it is solde: within a yeere may he bye it out.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But if it be not bought out within ye space of a ful yeere, then the house that is in the walled citie, shalbe stablished, as cut off from the familie, to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not goe out in the Iubile.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But the houses of villages, which haue no walles round about them, shalbe esteemed as the fielde of the countrey: they may be bought out againe, and shall goe out in the Iubile.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Notwithstanding, the cities of the Leuites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Leuites redeeme at all seasons.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And if a man purchase of the Leuites, the house that was solde, and the citie of their possession shall goe out in the Iubile: for the houses of the cities of the Leuites are their possession among the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the fielde of the suburbes of their cities, shall not be solde: for it is their perpetuall possession.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Moreouer, if thy brother be impouerished, and fallen in decay with thee, thou shalt relieue him, and as a stranger and soiourner, so shall he liue with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Thou shalt take no vsurie of him, nor vantage, but thou shalt feare thy God, that thy brother may liue with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thou shalt not giue him thy money to vsurie, nor lende him thy vitailes for increase.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I am the Lord your God, which haue brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to giue you the lande of Canaan, and to be your God.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>If thy brother also that dwelleth by thee, be impouerished, and be sold vnto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serue as a bond seruant,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But as an hired seruant, and as a soiourner he shalbe with thee: he shall serue thee vnto the yeere of the Iubile.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then shall he depart from thee, both hee, and his children with him, and shall returne vnto his familie, and vnto the possession of his fathers shall he returne:  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>For they are my seruants, whom I brought out of the lande of Egypt: they shall not be solde as bondmen are solde.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Thou shalt not rule ouer him cruelly, but shalt feare thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Thy bond seruant also, and thy bond maid, which thou shalt haue, shalbe of the heathen that are rounde about you: of them shall ye bye seruants and maydes.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And moreouer of the children of the stragers, that are soiourners among you, of them shall ye bye, and of their families that are with you, which they begate in your lande: these shall be your possession.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>So ye shall take them as inheritance for your children after you, to possesse them by inheritance, ye shall vse their labours for euer: but ouer your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule one ouer another with crueltie.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>If a soiourner or a stranger dwelling by thee get riches, and thy brother by him be impouerished, and sell him selfe vnto the stranger or soiourner dwelling by thee, or to the stocke of the strangers familie,  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>After that he is solde, he may be bought out: one of his brethren may bye him out,  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Or his vncle, or his vncles sonne may bye him out, or any of the kindred of his flesh among his familie, may redeeme him: either if he can get so much, he may bye him selfe out.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then he shall recken with his byer from the yeere that he was solde to him, vnto the yere of Iubile: and the money of his sale shalbe according to the number of yeeres: according to the time of an hyred seruant shall he be with him.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>If there be many yeeres behind, according to them he shall giue againe for his deliuerance, of the money that he was bought for.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>If there remaine but fewe yeeres vnto the yeere of Iubile, then he shall count with him, and according to his yeeres giue againe for his redemption.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>He shalbe with him yeere by yeere as an hired seruant: he shall not rule cruelly ouer him in thy sight.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And if he be not redeemed thus, he shall go out in the yeere of Iubile, he, and his children with him.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>For vnto me the children of Israel are seruants: they are my seruants, who I haue brought out of the land of Egypt: I am ye Lord your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
