Beholde, euen I see it, sayeth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But go ye nowe vnto my place which was in Shilo, where I set my Name at the beginning, and beholde, what I did to it for the wickednesse of my people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore nowe because yee haue done all these woorkes, sayeth the Lord, (and I rose vp earely and spake vnto you: but when I spake, yee would not heare me, neither when I called, would yee answere).  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore will I do vnto this House, wherupon my Name is called, wherein also yee trust, euen vnto the place that I gaue to you and to your fathers, as I haue done vnto Shilo.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will cast you out of my sight, as I haue cast out all your brethren, euen the whole seede of Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therfore thou shalt not pray for this people, neither lift vp crie or praier for them neither intreat me, for I will not heare thee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Seest thou not what they doe in the cities of Iudah and in the streetes of Ierusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knede the dough to make cakes to the Queene of heauen and to powre out drinke offrings vnto other gods, that they may prouoke me vnto anger.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Doe they prouoke me to anger, sayeth the Lord, and not themselues to the confusion of their owne faces?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore thus sayeth the Lord God, Beholde, mine anger and my wrath shall be powred vpon this place, vpon man and vpon beast, and vpon the tree of the fielde, and vpon the fruite of the grounde, and it shall burne and not bee quenched.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Put your burnt offerings vnto your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For I spake not vnto your fathers, nor commanded them, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offrings and sacrifices.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voyce, and I will be your God, and yee shalbe my people: and walke yee in all the wayes which I haue commanded you, that it may be well vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But they would not obey, nor incline their eare, but went after the counsels and the stubbernesse of their wicked heart, and went backewarde and not forwarde.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Since the day that your fathers came vp out of the lande of Egypt, vnto this day, I haue euen sent vnto you al my seruants the Prophets, rising vp earely euery day, and sending them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Yet would they not heare me nor encline their eare, but hardened their necke and did worse then their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore shalt thou speake al these words vnto them, but they will not heare thee: thou shalt also crie vnto them, but they will not answere thee.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But thou shalt say vnto them, This is a nation that heareth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiueth discipline: trueth is perished, and is cleane gone out of their mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Cut off thine heare, O Ierusalem, and cast it away, and take vp a complaint on the hie places: for the Lord hath reiected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For the children of Iudah haue done euill in my sight, sayth the Lord: they haue set their abominations in the House, whereupon my Name is called, to pollute it.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they haue built the hie place of Topheth, which is in the valley of Ben-Hinnom to burne their sonnes and their daughters in the fire, which I commanded them not, neither came it in mine heart.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore beholde, the dayes come, sayeth the Lord, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall burie in Topheth til there be no place.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And ye carkeises of this people shalbe meat for the foules of the heauen and for the beastes of the earth, and none shall fraie them away.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Iudah and from the streetes of Ierusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladnesse, the voice of the bridegrom and the voice of the bride: for the lande shalbe desolate. </div><ul class='tnav'>
