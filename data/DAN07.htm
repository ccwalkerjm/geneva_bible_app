It had great yron teeth: it deuoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue vnder his feete: and it was vnlike to the beasts that were before it: for it had ten hornes.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>As I considered the hornes, beholde, there came vp among them another litle horne, before whome there were three of the first hornes pluckt away: and behold, in this horne were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking presumptuous things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I behelde, till the thrones were set vp, and the Ancient of dayes did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the heare of his head like the pure wooll: his throne was like the fierie flame, and his wheeles as burning fire.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A fierie streame yssued, and came foorth from before him: thousand thousandes ministred vnto him, and tenne thousand thousands stoode before him: the iudgement was set, and the bookes opened.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then I behelde, because of the voyce of the presumptuous wordes, which the horne spake: I behelde, euen till the beast was slaine, and his body destroyed, and giuen to the burning fire.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As concerning the other beastes, they had taken away their dominion: yet their liues were prolonged for a certaine time and season.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As I behelde in visions by night, behold, one like the sonne of man came in the cloudes of heauen, and approched vnto the Ancient of dayes, and they brought him before him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he gaue him dominion, and honour, and a kingdome, that all people, nations and languages should serue him: his dominion is an euerlasting dominion, which shall neuer bee taken away: and his kingdome shall neuer be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I Daniel was troubled in my spirit, in the middes of my body, and the visions of mine head made me afraide.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore I came vnto one of them that stoode by, and asked him the trueth of all this: so he tolde me, and shewed me the interpretation of these things.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>These great beastes which are foure, are foure Kings, which shall arise out of the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they shall take the kingdome of the Saintes of the most High, and possesse the kingdome for euer, euen for euer and euer.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>After this, I woulde knowe the trueth of the fourth beast, which was so vnlike to all the others, very fearefull, whose teeth were of yron, and his nailes of brasse: which deuoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue vnder his feete.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Also to know of the tenne hornes that were in his head, and of the other which came vp, before whome three fell, and of the horne that had eyes, and of the mouth that spake presumptuous thinges, whose looke was more stoute then his fellowes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I beheld, and the same horne made battel against the Saintes, yea, and preuailed against them,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Vntill the Ancient of dayes came, and iudgement was giuen to the Saintes of the most High: and the time approched, that the Saintes possessed the kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdome in the earth, which shall be vnlike to all the kingdomes, and shall deuoure the whole earth, and shall treade it downe and breake it in pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the ten hornes out of this kingdome are tenne Kings that shall rise: and an other shall rise after them, and he shall be vnlike to the first, and he shall subdue three Kings,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And shall speake wordes against the most High, and shall consume the Saintes of the most High, and thinke that he may change times and lawes, and they shalbe giuen into his hand, vntill a time, and times and the deuiding of time.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the iudgement shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and destroy it vnto the ende.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the kingdome, and dominion, and the greatnesse of the kingdome vnder the whole heauen shalbe giue to the holy people of the most High, whose kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome and all powers shall serue and obey him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Euen this is the ende of the matter, I Daniel had many cogitations which troubled mee, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in mine heart. </div><ul class='tnav'>
