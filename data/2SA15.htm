And he answered, Thy seruant is of one of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Absalom said vnto him, See, thy matters are good and righteous, but there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Absalom sayd moreouer, Oh that I were made Iudge in the lande, that euery man which hath any matter of controuersie, might come to me, that I might do him iustice.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when any man came neere to him, and did him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and tooke him, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And on this maner did Absalom to al Israel, that came to the King for iudgement: so Absalom stale the hearts of the men of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And after fourtie yeeres, Absalom sayd vnto the King, I pray thee, let me go to Hebron, and render my vowe which I haue vowed vnto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For thy seruant vowed a vowe when I remayned at Geshur, in Aram, saying, If the Lord shall bring me againe in deede to Ierusalem, I will serue the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the King sayd vnto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Absalom sent spyes throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When yee heare the sound of the trumpet, Ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And with Absalom went two hundreth men out of Ierusalem, that were called: and they went in their simplicitie, knowing nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Also Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite Dauids counseller, from his citie Giloh, while he offred sacrifices: and the treason was great: for the people encreased still with Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then came a messenger to Dauid, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are turned after Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Dauid sayd vnto all his seruants that were with him at Ierusalem, Vp, and let vs flee: for we shall not escape from Absalom: make speede to depart, lest he come suddenly and take vs, and bring euill vpon vs, and smite the citie with the edge of the sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Kings seruants sayd vnto him, Behold, thy seruants are ready to do according to all that my lord the King shall appoynt.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the King departed and all his houshold after him, and the King left ten concubines to keepe the house.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the King went forth and all the people after him, and taried in a place farre off.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And all his seruants went about him, and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites, euen sixe hudreth men which were come after him from Gath, went before the King.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then sayde the King to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore commest thou also with vs? Returne aud abide with the King, for thou art a stranger: depart thou therefore to thy place.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou camest yesterday, and should I cause thee to wander to day and go with vs? I will goe whither I can: therefore returne thou and cary againe thy brethren: mercy and trueth be with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ittai answered the King, and sayde, As the Lord liueth, and as my lord the King liueth, in what place my lord the King shalbe, whether in death or life, euen there surely will thy seruant bee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Dauid sayd to Ittai, Come, and go forward. And Ittai the Gittite went, and all his men, and all the children that were with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And all the countrey wept with a loude voyce, and all the people went forward, but the King passed ouer the brooke Kidron: and all the people went ouer toward the way of ye wildernes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And lo, Zadok also was there, and all the Leuites with him, bearing the Arke of the couenant of God: and they set downe the Arke of God, and Abiathar went vp vntill the people were all come out of the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then the King said vnto Zadok, Carie the Arke of God againe into the citie: if I shall finde fauour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me againe, and shewe me both it, and the Tabernacle thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But if he thus say, I haue no delite in thee, behold, here am I, let him doe to me as seemeth good in his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The King sayde againe vnto Zadok the Priest, Art not thou a Seer? returne into the citie in peace, and your two sonnes with you: to wit, Ahimaaz thy sonne, and Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Behold, I wil tarie in the fieldes of the wildernesse, vntill there come some worde from you to be tolde me.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Zadok therefore and Abiathar caried the Arke of God againe to Ierusalem, and they taried there.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Dauid went vp the mount of oliues and wept as he went vp, and had his head couered, and went barefooted: and al the people that was with him, had euery man his head couered, and as they went vp, they wept.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then one tolde Dauid, saying, Ahithophel is one of them that haue cospired with Absalom: and Dauid sayde, O Lord, I pray thee, turne the counsell of Ahithophel into foolishnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then Dauid came to the toppe of the mount where he worshipped God: and beholde, Hushai the Archite came against him with his coate torne, and hauing earth vpon his head.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Vnto whom Dauid sayd, If thou goe with me, thou shalt be a burthen vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But if thou returne to the citie, and say vnto Absalom, I wil be thy seruant, O King, (as I haue bene in time past thy fathers seruant, so will I now be thy seruant) then thou mayest bring me the counsell of Ahithophel to nought.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the Priests? therefore what so euer thou shalt heare out of the Kings house, thou shalt shew to Zadok and Abiathar the Priests.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Beholde, there are with them their two sonnes: Ahimaaz Zadoks sonne, and Ionathan Abiathars sonne: by them also shall ye send me euery thing that ye can heare.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So Hushai Dauids friend went into the citie: and Absalom came into Ierusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
