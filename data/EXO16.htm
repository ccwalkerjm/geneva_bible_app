And Moses sayd vnto them, This is the breade which the Lord hath giuen you to eate.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded: gather of it euery man according to his eating an Omer for a man according to the number of your persons: euery man shall take for them which are in his tent.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some lesse.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when they did measure it with an Omer, hee that had gathered much, had nothing ouer, and he that had gathered litle, had no lacke: so euery man gathered according to his eating.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Moses then said vnto them, Let no man reserue thereof till morning.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Notwithstanding they obeyed not Moses: but some of them reserued of it till morning, and it was full of wormes, and stanke: therefore Moses was angrie with them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they gathered it euery morning, euery man according to his eating: for when the heate of the sunne came, it was melted.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the sixt day they gathered twise so much bread, two Omers for one man: then all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he answered them, This is that, which the Lord hath sayde, To morowe is the rest of the holy Sabbath vnto the Lord: bake that to day which ye wil bake, and seethe that which ye wil seethe, and all that remaineth, lay it vp to be kept till the morning for you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they laied it vp till the morning, as Moses bade, and it stanke not, neyther was there any worme therein.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Moses sayde, Eate that to day: for to day is the Sabbath vnto the Lord: to day ye shall not finde it in the fielde.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Sixe dayes shall yee gather it, but in the seuenth day is the Sabbath: in it there shalbe none.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Notwithstanding, there went out some of the people in ye seuenth day for to gather, and they found none.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the Lord sayde vnto Moses, Howe long refuse yee to keepe my commandements, and my lawes?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Beholde, howe the Lord hath giuen you the Sabbath: therefore he giueth you the sixt day bread for two dayes: tary therefore euery man in his place: let no man goe out of his place the seuenth day.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So the people rested the seuenth day.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the house of Israel called the name of it, MAN. and it was like to coriander seede, but white: and the taste of it was like vnto wafers made with hony.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Moses said, This is that which the Lord hath commanded, Fill an Omer of it, to keepe it for your posteritie: that they may see the bread wherewith I haue fed you in wildernesse, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Moses also said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an Omer full of MAN therein, and set it before the Lord to be kept for your posteritie.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laied it vp before the Testimonie to be kept.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the children of Israel did eate MAN fourtie yeres, vntill they came vnto a land inhabited: they did eate MAN vntill they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The Omer is the tenth part of the Ephah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
