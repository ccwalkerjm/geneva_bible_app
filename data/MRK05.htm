I will that thou sweare to me by God, that thou torment me not.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>(For hee saide vnto him, Come out of the man, thou vncleane spirit.)  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he asked him, What is thy name? and hee answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And hee prayed him instantly, that hee would not send them away out of the countrey.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now there was there in the mountaines a great heard of swine, feeding.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all ye deuils besought him, saying, Send vs into the swine, that we may enter into them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And incontinently Iesus gaue them leaue. Then the vncleane spirites went out, and entred into the swine, and the heard ranne headlong from the high banke into the sea, (and there were about two thousand swine) and they were choked vp in the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the swineheards fled, and told it in the citie, and in the countrey, and they came out to see what it was that was done.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they came to Iesus, and sawe him that had bene possessed with the deuil, and had the legion, sit both clothed, and in his right minde: and they were afraide.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they that saw it, tolde them, what was done to him that was possessed with the deuil, and concerning the swine.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then they began to pray him, that hee would depart from their coastes.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when he was come into the shippe, he that had bene possessed with the deuil, prayed him that he might be with him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Howbeit, Iesus would not suffer him, but said vnto him, Goe thy way home to thy friendes, and shewe them what great thinges the Lord hath done vnto thee, and howe hee hath had compassion on thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis, what great things Iesus had done vnto him: and all men did marueile.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when Iesus was come ouer againe by ship vnto the other side, a great multitude gathered together to him, and he was neere vnto the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And beholde, there came one of the rulers of the Synagogue, whose name was Iairus: and when he sawe him, he fell downe at his feete,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And besought him instantly, saying, My litle daughter lyeth at point of death: I pray thee that thou wouldest come and lay thine hands on her, that she may be healed, and liue.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then hee went with him, and a great multitude folowed him, and thronged him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>(And there was a certaine woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelue yeeres,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And had suffred many things of many physicions, and had spent all that she had, and it auailed her nothing, but she became much worse.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>When she had heard of Iesus, shee came in the preasse behinde, and touched his garment.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For she said, If I may but touch his clothes, I shalbe whole.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And straightway the course of her blood was dried vp, and she felt in her body, that she was healed of that plague.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And immediatly when Iesus did knowe in himselfe the vertue that went out of him, he turned him round about in the preasse, and said, Who hath touched my clothes?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And his disciples said vnto him, Thou seest the multitude throng thee, and sayest thou, Who did touche me?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he looked round about, to see her that had done that.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the woman feared and trembled: for she knewe what was done in her, and shee came and fell downe before him, and tolde him the whole trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And hee saide to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole: go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.)  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>While hee yet spake, there came from the same ruler of the Synagogues house certaine which said, Thy daughter is dead: why diseasest thou the Master any further?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Assoone as Iesus heard that word spoken, he said vnto the ruler of the Synagogue, Be not afraide: onely beleeue.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he suffered no man to follow him saue Peter and Iames, and Iohn the brother of Iames.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>So hee came vnto the house of the ruler of the Synagogue, and sawe the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he went in, and said vnto them, Why make ye this trouble, and weepe? the childe is not dead, but sleepeth.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And they laught him to scorne: but hee put them all out, and tooke the father, and the mother of the childe, and them that were with him, and entred in where the childe lay,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And tooke the childe by the hand, and saide vnto her, Talitha cumi, which is by interpretation, Mayden, I say vnto thee, arise.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And straightway the mayden arose, and walked: for shee was of the age of twelue yeeres, and they were astonied out of measure.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he charged them straitly that no man should knowe of it, and commanded to giue her meate. </div><ul class='tnav'>
