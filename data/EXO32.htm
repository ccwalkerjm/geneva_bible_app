 <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wherefore shall the Egyptians speake, and say, He hath brought them out maliciously for to slay them in the mountaines, and to consume them from the earth? turne from thy fearce wrath, and change thy minde from this euill towarde thy people.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Remember Abraham, Izhak, and Israel thy seruants, to whom thou swarest by thine owne selfe, and saydest vnto them, I wil multiply your seede, as the starres of the heauen, and all this land, that I haue spoken of, wil I giue vnto your seede, and they shall inherit it for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the Lord changed his minde from the euil, which he threatned to do vnto his people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So Moses returned and went downe from the mountaine with the two Tables of the Testimonie in his hande: the Tables were written on both their sides, euen on the one side and on the other were they written.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And these Tables were the worke of God, and this writing was the writing of God grauen in the Tables.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when Ioshua heard the noyse of the people, as they shouted, he said vnto Moses, There is a noyse of warre in the hoste.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Who answered, It is not the noyse of them that haue the victorie, nor the noyse of them that are ouercome: but I do heare ye noyse of singing.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Nowe, as soone as he came neere vnto the hoste, he sawe the calfe and the dancing: so Moses wrath waxed hote, and he cast the Tables out of his handes, and brake them in pieces beneath the mountaine.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>After, he tooke the calfe, which they had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it vnto powder, and strowed it vpon the water, and made the children of Israel drinke of it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Also Moses said vnto Aaron, What did this people vnto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Aaron answered, Let not the wrath of my Lord waxe fearce: Thou knowest this people, that they are euen set on mischiefe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they sayde vnto me, Make vs gods to go before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses (the man that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.)  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then I sayde to them, Ye that haue golde, plucke it off: and they brought it me, and I did cast it into the fire, and thereof came this calfe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Moses therefore sawe that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked vnto their shame among their enemies)  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Moses stoode in ye gate of the campe, and sayde, Who pertaineth to the Lord? let him come to mee. And all the sonnes of Leui gathered themselues vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then he said vnto them, Thus sayth ye Lord God of Israel, Put euery man his sworde by his side: go to and from, from gate to gate, through the hoste, and slay euery man his brother, and euery man his companion, and euery man his neighbour.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So the children of Leui did as Moses had commanded: and there fel of the people the same day about three thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>(For Moses had said, Cosecrate your hands vnto the Lord this day, euen euery man vpon his sonne, and vpon his brother, that there may be giuen you a blessing this day)  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when the morning came, Moses sayde vnto the people, Yee haue committed a grieuous crime: but now I wil goe vp to the Lord, if I may pacifie him for your sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Moses therefore went againe vnto ye Lord, and said, Oh, this people haue sinned a great sinne, and haue made them gods of golde.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore now if thou pardon their sinne, thy mercy shall appeare: but if thou wilt not, I pray thee, rase me out of thy booke, which thou hast written.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then the Lord sayd to Moses, Whosoeuer hath sinned against me, I will put out of my booke.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Go nowe therefore, bring the people vnto the place which I commanded thee: behold, mine Angel shall goe before thee, but yet in the day of my visitation I wil visite their sinne vpon them.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So the Lord plagued the people, because they caused Aaron to make ye calfe which he made. </div><ul class='tnav'>
