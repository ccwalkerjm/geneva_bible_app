I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the blood shalbe a token for you vpon the houses where ye are: so when I see the blood, I will passe ouer you, and the plague shall not be vpon you to destruction, when I smite the lande of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And this day shalbe vnto you a remembrance: and ye shall keepe it an holie feast vnto the Lord, throughout your generations: yee shall keepe it holie by an ordinance for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Seuen daies shall ye eat vnleauened bread, and in any case ye shall put away leauen the first day out of your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread from the first daie vntill the seuenth day, that person shalbe cut off from Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And in the first day shalbe an holie assemblie: also in the seuenth day shalbe an holy assemblie vnto you: no worke shalbe done in them, saue about that which euery man must eate: that onely may ye do.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Ye shall keepe also the feast of vnleauened bread: for that same daye I will bring your armies out of the lande of Egypt: therefore ye shall obserue this day, throughout your posteritie, by an ordinance for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>In the first moneth and the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen, yee shall eate vnleauened bread vnto the one and twentieth day of the moneth at euen.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Seuen daies shall no leauen be founde in your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread, that person shalbe cut off from the Congregation of Israel: whether he bee a stranger, or borne in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Ye shall eate no leauened bread: but in all your habitations shall ye eate vnleauened bread.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Moses called all the Elders of Israel, and saide vnto them, Choose out and take you for euerie of your housholdes a lambe, and kill the Passeouer.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basen, and strike the lintell, and the doore cheekes with the blood that is in the basen, and let none of you goe out at the doore of his house, vntill the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the Lord will passe by to smite the Egyptians: and when he seeth the blood vpon the lintel and on the two doore cheekes, the Lord wil passe ouer the doore, and wil not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to plague you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore shall ye obserue this thing as an ordinance both for thee and thy sonnes for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when ye shall come into the land, which the Lord will giue you as hee hath promised, then ye shall keepe this seruice.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when your children aske you, What seruice is this ye keepe?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then ye shall saye, It is the sacrifice of the Lordes Passeouer, which passed ouer the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and preserued our houses. Then the people bowed them selues, and worshipped.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So the children of Israel went, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron: so did they.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Nowe at midnight, the Lord smote all the first borne in the lande of Egypt, from the first borne of Pharaoh that sate on his throne, vnto the first borne of the captiue that was in prison, and all the first borne of beastes.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Pharaoh rose vp in the night, he, and all his seruants and all the Egyptians: and there was a great crye in Egypt: for there was no house where there was not one dead.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And hee called to Moses and to Aaron by night, and saide, Rise vp, get you out from among my people, both yee, and the children of Israel, and goe serue the Lord as ye haue sayde.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Take also your sheepe and your cattell as yee haue sayde, and depart, and blesse me also.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the Egyptians did force the people, because they would send them out of the land in haste: for they said, We die all.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Therfore the people tooke their dough before it was leauened, euen their dough bound in clothes vpon their shoulders.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the children of Israel did according to the saying of Moses, and they asked of ye Egyptians iewels of siluer and iewels of gold, and raiment.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the Lord gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: and they graunted their request: so they spoyled the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then the children of Israel tooke their iourney from Rameses to Succoth about sixe hundreth thousand men of foote, beside children.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And a great multitude of sundrie sortes of people went out with them, and sheepe, and beeues, and cattel in great abundance.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt, and made vnleauened cakes: for it was not leauened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, neither coulde they tarie, nor yet prepare themselues vitailes.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So the dwelling of the children of Israel, while they dwelled in Egypt, was foure hundreth and thirtie yeres.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when the foure hundreth and thirtie yeeres were expired, euen the selfe same day departed all the hostes of the Lord out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>It is a night to be kept holie to the Lord, because he brought them out of the lande of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord, which all the children of Israel must keepe throughout their generations.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Also the Lord said vnto Moses and Aaron, This is the Lawe of the Passeouer: no stranger shall eate thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>But euerie seruant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>A stranger or an hyred seruant shall not eat thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>In one house shall it bee eaten: thou shalt carie none of ye flesh out of the house, neither shall ye breake a bone thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>All the Congregation of Israel shall obserue it.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>But if a stranger dwell with thee, and will obserue the Passeouer of the Lord, let him circumcise all the males, that belong vnto him, and then let him come and obserue it, and he shall be as one that is borne in the land: for none vncircumcised person shall eate thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>One lawe shalbe to him that is borne in the land, and to the stranger that dwelleth among you.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then all the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron: so did they.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And the selfe same day did the Lord bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. </div><ul class='tnav'>
