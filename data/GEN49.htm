He shall lye downe and couche as a Lion, and as a Lionesse: Who shall stirre him vp?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The scepter shall not depart from Iudah, nor a Lawegiuer from betweene his feete, vntill Shiloh come, and the people shall be gathered vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He shall binde his Asse foale vnto ye vine, and his Asses colte vnto the best vine. hee shall wash his garment in wine, and his cloke in the blood of grapes.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His eyes shalbe red with wine, and his teeth white with milke.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Zebulun shall dwell by the sea side, and he shalbe an hauen for shippes: and his border shalbe vnto Zidon.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Issachar shalbe a strong asse, couching downe betweene two burdens:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he shall see that rest is good, and that the land is pleasant, and he shall bow his shoulder to beare, and shalbe subiect vnto tribute.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Dan shall iudge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder by the path, byting the horse heeles, so that his rider shall fall backward.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>O Lord, I haue waited for thy saluation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Gad, an hoste of men shall ouercome him, but he shall ouercome at the last.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Concerning Asher, his bread shalbe fat, and he shall giue pleasures for a king.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Naphtali shalbe a hinde let goe, giuing goodly wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ioseph shalbe a fruitefull bough, euen a fruitful bough by the well side: the small boughs shall runne vpon the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the archers grieued him, and shotte against him and hated him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But his bowe abode strong, and the hands of his armes were strengthened, by the handes of the mighty God of Iaakob, of whom was the feeder appointed, by the stone of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Euen by the God of thy father, who shall helpe thee, and by the almightie, who shall blesse thee with heauenly blessinges from aboue, with blessings of the deepe, that lyeth beneath, with blessings of the brestes, and of the wombe.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The blessings of thy father shalbe stronger then the blessings of mine elders: vnto the ende of the hilles of the worlde they shall be on the head of Ioseph, and on the top of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Beniamin shall rauine as a wolfe: in the morning he shall deuoure the pray, and at night he shall deuide the spoyle.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>All these are the twelue tribes of Israel, and thus their father spake vnto them, and blessed them: euery one of them blessed hee with a seuerall blessing.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he charged them and sayd vnto them, I am ready to be gathered vnto my people: burie mee with my fathers in the caue, that is in the fielde of Ephron the Hittite,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>In the caue that is in the field of Machpelah besides Mamre in the land of Canaan: which caue Abraham bought with the fielde of Ephron the Hittite for a possession to burie in.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife: there they buryed Izhak and Rebekah his wife: and there I buried Leah.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The purchase of the fielde and the caue that is therein, was bought of the children of Heth.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Thus Iaakob made an end of giuing charge to his sonnes, and plucked vp his feete into the bed and gaue vp the ghost, and was gathered to his people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
