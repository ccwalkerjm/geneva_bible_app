 <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Haue the gods of the nations deliuered them, which my fathers haue destroyed? as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden, which were at Telassar?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Where is the King of Hamath, and the King of Arpad, and the King of the citie of Sepharuaim, Hena and Iuah?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Hezekiah receiued the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went vp into the House of the Lord, and Hezekiah spread it before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Hezekiah prayed vnto the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>O Lord of hostes, God of Israel, which dwellest betweene the Cherubims, thou art very God alone ouer all the kingdomes of the earth: thou hast made the heauen and the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Encline thine eare, O Lord, and heare: open thine eyes, O Lord, and see, and heare all the wordes of Saneherib, who hath sent to blaspheme the liuing God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Trueth it is, O Lord, that the Kings of Asshur haue destroyed all lands, and their countrey,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And haue cast their gods in ye fire: for they were no gods, but the worke of mans hands, euen wood or stone: therefore they destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Nowe therefore, O Lord our God, saue thou vs out of his hand, that all the kingdomes of the earth may knowe, that thou onely art the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent vnto Hezekiah, saying, Thus sayth the Lord God of Israel, Because thou hast prayed vnto me, concerning Saneherib king of Asshur,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>This is the worde that the Lord hath spoken against him, the virgine, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorne: the daughter of Ierusalem, hath shaken her head at thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whome hast thou railed on and blasphemed? and against whome hast thou exalted thy voyce, and lifted vp thine eyes on hie? euen against the holy one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>By thy seruants hast thou railed on the Lord, and sayd, By the multitude of my charets I am come vp to the top of the mountaines to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut downe the hie cedars thereof, and the faire firre trees thereof, and I will goe vp to the heightes of his top and to the forest of his fruitfull places.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I haue digged and drunke the waters, and with the plant of my feete haue I dryed all the riuers closed in.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Hast thou not heard howe I haue of olde time made it, and haue formed it long ago? and should I now bring it, that it should be destroyed, and layde on ruinous heapes, as cities defensed?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Whose inhabitants haue small power, and are afrayd and confounded: they are like the grasse of the field and greene herbe, or grasse on the house tops, or corne blassed afore it be growen.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But I know thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy comming in, and thy fury against me.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Because thou ragest against me, and thy tumult is come vnto mine eares, therefore will I put mine hooke in thy nostrels, and my bridle in thy lips, and wil bring thee backe againe the same way thou camest.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And this shalbe a signe vnto thee, O Hezekiah, Thou shalt eate this yeere such as groweth of it selfe: and the second yeere, such things as growe without sowing: and in the third yeere, sowe ye and reape, and plant vineyards, and eate the fruite thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Iudah, shall againe take roote downward and beare fruite vpward.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For out of Ierusalem shall goe a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeale of the Lord of hostes shall doe this.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore thus sayth the Lord, concerning the King of Asshur, He shall not enter into this citie, nor shoote an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a mount against it.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>By the same way that he came, he shall returne, and not come into this citie, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For I will defend this citie to saue it, for mine owne sake, and for my seruant Dauids sake.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then the Angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the campe of Asshur an hundreth, fourescore, and fiue thousand: so when they arose early in the morning, beholde, they were all dead corpses.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So Saneherib king of Asshur departed, and went away and returned and dwelt at Nineueh.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And as he was in the temple worshipping of Nisroch his god, Adramelech and Sharezer his sonnes slewe him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat: and Esarhaddon his sonne reigned in his steade. </div><ul class='tnav'>
