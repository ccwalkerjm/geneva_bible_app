And he said vnto me, Take it, and eate it vp, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shalbe in thy mouth as sweete as honie.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then I tooke the litle booke out of ye Angels hand, and ate it vp, and it was in my mouth as sweete as hony: but whe I had eaten it my belly was bitter.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he said vnto me, Thou must prophecie againe among the people and nations, and tongues, and to many Kings. </div><ul class='tnav'>
