the length thereof is nine cubites, and foure cubites the breadth of it, after the cubite of a man.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And this land which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the riuer of Arnon, and halfe mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gaue I vnto the Reubenites and Gadites.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdome of Og, gaue I vnto the halfe tribe of Manasseh: euen all the countrey of Argob with all Bashan, which is called, The land of gyants.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Iair the sonne of Manasseh tooke all the countrey of Argob, vnto the coastes of Geshuri, and of Maachathi: and called them after his owne name, Bashan, Hauoth Iair vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I gaue part of Gilead vnto Machir.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And vnto the Reubenites and Gadites I gaue the rest of Gilead, and vnto the riuer of Arnon, halfe the riuer and the borders, euen vnto the riuer Iabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The plaine also and Iorden, and the borders from Chinneereth euen vnto the Sea of the plaine, to wit, the salt Sea vnder the springs of Pisgah Eastwarde.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I commanded you the same time, saying, The Lord your God hath giuen you this lande to possesse it: ye shall goe ouer armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all men of warre.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Your wiues onely, and your children, and your cattel (for I know that ye haue much cattel) shall abide in your cities, which I haue giuen you,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Vntill the Lord haue giuen rest vnto your brethren as vnto you, and that they also possesse the lande, which the Lord your God hath giuen them beyond Iorden: then shall ye returne euery man vnto his possession, which I haue giuen you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I charged Ioshua the same time, saying, Thine eyes haue seene all that the Lord your God hath done vnto these two Kings: so shall the Lord doe vnto all the kingdomes whither thou goest.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ye shall not feare them: for the Lord your God, he shall fight for you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I besought the Lord the same time, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>O Lord God, thou hast begunne to shewe thy seruant thy greatnesse and thy mightie hande: for where is there a God in heauen or in earth, that can do like thy workes, and like thy power?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I pray thee let me go ouer and see the good land that is beyond Iorden, that goodly mountaine, and Lebanon.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the Lord was angrie with me for your sakes, and would not heare me: and the Lord said vnto me, Let it suffice thee, speake no more vnto me of this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Get thee vp into the top of Pisgah, and lift vp thine eyes Westward, and Northwarde, and Southward, and Eastward, and behold it with thine eyes, for thou shalt not goe ouer this Iorden:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But charge Ioshua, and incourage him, and bolden him: for hee shall goe before this people, and he shall deuide for inheritance vnto them, the land which thou shalt see.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So wee abode in the valley ouer against Beth-Peor. </div><ul class='tnav'>
