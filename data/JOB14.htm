All the dayes of mine appointed time will I waite, till my changing shall come.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou shalt call me, and I shall answere thee: thou louest the worke of thine own hands.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But nowe thou nombrest my steppes, and doest not delay my sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Mine iniquitie is sealed vp, as in a bagge, and thou addest vnto my wickednesse.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And surely as the mountaine that falleth, commeth to nought, and the rocke that is remooued from his place:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As the water breaketh the stones, when thou ouerflowest the things which growe in the dust of ye earth: so thou destroyest ye hope of man.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou preuailest alway against him, so that he passeth away: he changeth his face when thou castest him away.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he knoweth not if his sonnes shall be honourable, neither shall he vnderstand concerning them, whether they shalbe of lowe degree,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But while his flesh is vpon him, he shall be sorowfull, and while his soule is in him, it shall mourne. </div><ul class='tnav'>
