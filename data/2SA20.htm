And he answered, Yea. And she said to him, Heare the wordes of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do heare.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then shee spake thus, They spake in the olde time, saying, They shoulde aske of Abel. and so haue they continued.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am one of them, that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: and thou goest about to destroy a citie, and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou deuoure the inheritance of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ioab answered, and said, God forbid, God forbid it me, that I should deuoure, or destroy it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The matter is not so, but a man of mout Ephraim (Sheba ye sonne of Bichri by name) hath lift vp his had against ye King, euen against Dauid: deliuer vs him onely, and I will depart from the citie. And the woman saide vnto Ioab, Beholde, his head shalbe throwen to thee ouer the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then the woman went vnto all the people with her wisedome, and they cut off the head of Sheba the sonne of Bichri, and cast it to Ioab: the he blewe the trumpet, and they retired from the citie, euery man to his tent: and Ioab returned to Ierusalem vnto the King.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Ioab was ouer all the hoste of Israel, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada ouer the Cherethites and ouer the Pelethies,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Adoram ouer the tribute, and Ioshaphat the sonne of Ahilud the recorder,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Sheia was Scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar the Priests,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And also Ira the Iairite was chiefe about Dauid. </div><ul class='tnav'>
