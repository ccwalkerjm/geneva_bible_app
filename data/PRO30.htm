The prophecie which ye man spake vnto Ithiel, euen to Ithiel, and Vcal.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Surely I am more foolish then any man, and haue not the vnderstanding of a man in me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For I haue not learned wisedome, nor atteined to the knowledge of holy things.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who hath ascended vp to heauen, and descended? Who hath gathered the winde in his fist? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath established all the endes of the world? What is his name, and what is his sonnes name, if thou canst tell?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Euery worde of God is pure: he is a shield to those, that trust in him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Put nothing vnto his wordes, least he reproue thee, and thou be found a lyar.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Two things haue I required of thee: denie me them not before I die.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remooue farre from me vanitie and lyes: giue me not pouertie, nor riches: feede me with foode conuenient for me,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Least I be full, and denie thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or least I be poore and steale, and take the Name of my God in vaine.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Accuse not a seruant vnto his master, lest he curse thee, when thou hast offended.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is a generation that curseth their father, and doeth not blesse their mother.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are not washed from their filthinesse.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>There is a generation, whose eies are hautie, and their eye liddes are lifted vp.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>There is a generation, whose teeth are as swordes, and their chawes as kniues to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore from among men.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The horse leache hath two daughters which crye, Giue, giue. There be three things that will not be satisfied: yea, foure that say not, It is ynough.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The graue, and the barren wombe, the earth that cannot be satisfied with water, and the fire that sayeth not, It is ynough.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The eye that mocketh his father and despiseth the instruction of his mother, let ye rauens of the valley picke it out, and the yong eagles eate it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There be three thinges hid from me: yea, foure that I knowe not,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The way of an eagle in the aire, the way of a serpent vpon a stone, ye way of a ship in ye middes of the sea, and the way of a man with a maide.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Such is ye way also of an adulterous woman: she eateth and wipeth her mouth, and sayth, I haue not committed iniquitie.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For three things the earth is moued: yea, for foure it cannot susteine it selfe:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For a seruant when he reigneth, and a foole when he is filled with meate,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the hatefull woman, when she is married, and for a handmaid that is heire to her mistres.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>These be foure small things in the earth, yet they are wise and full of wisedome:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The pismires a people not strong, yet prepare they their meate in sommer:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The conies a people not mightie, yet make their houses in the rocke:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The grashopper hath no King, yet goe they forth all by bandes:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The spider taketh holde with her handes, and is in Kings palaces.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There be three thinges that order well their going: yea, foure are comely in going,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A lyon which is strong among beastes, and turneth not at the sight of any:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>A lusty grayhound, and a goate, and a King against whom there is no rising vp.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If thou hast bene foolish in lifting thy selfe vp, and if thou hast thought wickedly, lay thine hand vpon thy mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>When one churneth milke, he bringeth foorth butter: and he that wringeth his nose, causeth blood to come out: so he that forceth wrath, bringeth foorth strife. </div><ul class='tnav'>
