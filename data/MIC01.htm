Is not Samaria? and which are the hie places of Iudah? Is not Ierusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore I wil make Samaria as an heape of the fielde, and for the planting of a vineyard, and I will cause the stones thereof to tumble downe into the valley, and I will discouer the foundations thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And all the grauen images thereof shalbe broken, and all the giftes thereof shalbe burnt with the fire, and all the idoles thereof will I destroy: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall returne to the wages of an harlot.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore I will mourne and howle: I wil goe without clothes, and naked: I will make lamentation like the dragons, and mourning as the ostriches.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For her plagues are grieuous: for it is come into Iudah: the enemie is come vnto the gate of my people, vnto Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Declare ye it not at Gath, neither weepe ye: for the house of Aphrah roule thy selfe in the dust.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thou that dwellest at Shaphir, go together naked with shame: she that dwelleth at Zaanan, shall not come forth in ye mourning of Beth-ezel: the enemie shall receiue of you for his standing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For the inhabitant of Maroth wayted for good, but euill came from the Lord vnto the gate of Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, binde the charet to the beastes of price: she is the beginning of the sinne to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore shalt thou giue presents to Moresheth Gath: the houses of Achzib shalbe as a lye to the Kings of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yet will I bring an heire vnto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, he shall come vnto Adullam, the glorie of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Make thee balde: and shaue thee for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldenesse as the eagle, for they are gone into captiuity from thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
