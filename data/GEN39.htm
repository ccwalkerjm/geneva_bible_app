And Ioseph was a faire person, and well fauoured.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Nowe therefore after these thinges, his masters wife cast her eyes vpon Ioseph, and saide, Lye with me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But he refused and said to his masters wife, Beholde, my master knoweth not what he hath in the house with me, but hath committed all that he hath to mine hande.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There is no man greater in this house then I: neither hath he kept any thing from me, but only thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickednes and so sinne against God?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And albeit she spake to Ioseph day by day, yet he hearkened not vnto her, to lye with her, or to be in her company.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then on a certaine day Ioseph entred into the house, to doe his businesse: and there was no man of the houshold in the house:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore she caught him by his garmet, saying, Sleepe with me: but he left his garment in her hand and fled, and got him out.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Nowe when she sawe that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled out,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>She called vnto the men of her house, and tolde them, saying, Beholde, he hath brought in an Ebrewe vnto vs to mocke vs: who came in to me for to haue slept with me: but I cryed with a loude voyce.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when he heard that I lift vp my voice and cryed, he left his garment with me, and fled away, and got him out.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So she layde vp his garment by her, vntill her lord came home.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then she tolde him according to these words, saying, The Ebrew seruat, which thou hast brought vnto vs, came in to me, to mocke me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But assoone as I lift vp my voyce and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then when his master heard the wordes of his wife, which she tolde him, saying, After this maner did thy seruant to me, his anger was kindled.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Iosephs master tooke him and put him in prison, in the place, where the kings prisoners lay bounde: and there he was in prison.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the Lord was with Ioseph, and shewed him mercie, and got him fauour in the sight of the master of the prison.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the keeper of the prison committed to Iosephs hande all the prisoners that were in the prison, and whatsoeuer they did there, that did he.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the keeper of the prison looked vnto nothing that was vnder his hande, seeing that the Lord was with him: for whatsoeuer he did, the Lord made it to prosper. </div><ul class='tnav'>
