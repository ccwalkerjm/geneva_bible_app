So the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then God came vnto Balaam, and sayde, What men are these with thee?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Baalam said vnto God, Balak ye sonne of Zippor, king of Moab hath set vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt and couereth the face of the earth: come nowe, curse them for my sake: so it may be that I shalbe able to ouercome them in battell, and to driue them out.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And God said vnto Balaam, Go not thou with them, neither curse the people, for they are blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Balaam rose vp in the morning, and sayde vnto ye princes of Balak, Returne vnto your land: for the Lord hath refused to giue me leaue to go with you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the princes of Moab rose vp, and went vnto Balak, and sayd, Balaam hath refused to come with vs.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Balak yet sent againe moe princes, and more honourable then they.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Who came to Balaam, and sayde to him, Thus saith Balak the sonne of Zippor, Bee not thou staied, I pray thee, from comming vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For I wil promote thee vnto great honour, and wil do whatsoeuer thou sayest vnto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Balaam answered, and sayde vnto the seruants of Balak, If Balak woulde giue me his house full of siluer and golde, I can not goe beyonde the worde of the Lord my God, to doe lesse or more.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But nowe, I pray you, tary here this night, that I may wit, what the Lord will say vnto mee more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And God came vnto Balaam by night, and sayd vnto him, If the men come to call thee, rise vp, and goe with them: but onely what thing I say vnto thee, that shalt thou doe.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Balaam rose vp early, and sadled his asse, and went with the princes of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And ye wrath of God was kindled, because he went: and the Angel of the Lord stood in the way to be against him, as he rode vpon his asse, and his two seruants were with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when the asse saw the Angel of the Lord stand in the way, and his sworde drawen in his hand, the asse turned out of the way and went into the field, but Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the way.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Againe the Angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyardes, hauing a wall on the one side, and a wall on the other.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when the asse sawe the Angel of the Lord, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, and dasht Balaams foote against the wall: wherefore hee smote her againe.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the Angel of the Lord went further, and stoode in a narowe place, where was no way to turne, either to the right hand, or to the left.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when the asse sawe the Angell of the Lord, she lay downe vnder Balaam: therefore Balaam was very wroth, and smote the asse with a staffe.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the Lord opened the mouth of the asse, and she saide vnto Balaam, What haue I done vnto thee, that thou hast smitten me nowe three times?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Balaam saide vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked me: I woulde there were a sworde in mine hand, for nowe would I kill thee.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the asse saide vnto Balaam, Am not I thine asse, which thou hast ridden vpon since thy first time vnto this day? haue I vsed at any time to doe thus vnto thee? Who said, Nay.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he sawe the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with his sword drawen in his hande: then he bowed him selfe, and fell flat on his face.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the Angel of the Lord said vnto him, Wherefore hast thou nowe smitten thine asse three times? beholde, I came out to withstande thee, because thy way is not straight before me.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But the asse sawe me, and turned from me now three times: for els, if she had not turned from me, surely I had euen nowe slaine thee, and saued her aliue.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then Balaam saide vnto the Angel of the Lord, I haue sinned: for I wist not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore if it displease thee, I will turne home againe.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But the Angel said vnto Balaam, Go with the men: but what I say vnto thee, that shalt thou speake. So Balaam went with ye princes of Balak.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meete him vnto a citie of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, euen in the vtmost coast.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then Balak saide vnto Balaam, Did I not sende for thee to call thee? Wherefore camest thou not vnto me? am I not able in deede to promote thee vnto honour?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Balaam made answere vnto Balak, Lo, I am come vnto thee, and can I nowe say any thing at all? the worde that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speake.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>So Balaam went with Balak, and they came vnto the citie of Huzoth.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then Balak offred bullockes, and sheepe, and sent thereof to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And on the morowe Balak tooke Balaam, and brought him vp into the hie places of Baal, that thence hee might see the vtmost part of the people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
