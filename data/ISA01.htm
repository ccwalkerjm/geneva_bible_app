I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and of the fat of fed beasts: and I desire not the blood of bullocks, nor of lambs, nor of goates.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When ye come to appeare before me, who required this of your hands to tread in my courts?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Bring no more oblations, in vaine: incense is an abomination vnto me: I can not suffer your newe moones, nor Sabbaths, nor solemne dayes (it is iniquitie) nor solemne assemblies.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>My soule hateth your newe moones and your appointed feastes: they are a burden vnto me: I am weary to beare them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when you shall stretch out your hands, I wil hide mine eyes from you: and though ye make many prayers, I wil not heare: for your hands are full of blood.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Wash you, make you cleane: take away the euill of your workes from before mine eyes: cease to doe euill.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Learne to doe well: seeke iudgement, relieue the oppressed: iudge the fatherlesse and defend the widowe.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Come nowe, and let vs reason together, sayth the Lord: though your sinnes were as crimsin, they shalbe made white as snowe: though they were red like skarlet, they shalbe as wooll.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If ye consent and obey, ye shall eate the good things of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if ye refuse and be rebellious, ye shalbe deuoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Howe is the faithfull citie become an harlot? it was full of iudgement, and iustice lodged therein, but now they are murtherers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thy siluer is become drosse: thy wine is mixt with water.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thy Princes are rebellious and companions of theeues: euery one loueth giftes, and followeth after rewards: they iudge not the fatherlesse, neither doeth the widowes cause come before them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore sayth the Lord God of hostes, the mightie one of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine aduersaries, and auenge me of mine enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then I will turne mine hand vpon thee, and burne out thy drosse, till it be pure, and take away all thy tinne.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will restore thy iudges as at the first, and thy counsellers as at the beginning: afterward shalt thou be called a citie of righteousnes, and a faithfull citie.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Zion shall be redeemed in iudgement, and they that returne in her, in iustice.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the destruction of the transgressers and of the sinners shalbe together: and they that forsake the Lord, shalbe consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For they shalbe confounded for the okes, which ye haue desired, and ye shall be ashamed of the gardens, that ye haue chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For ye shalbe as an oke, whose leafe fadeth: and as a garden that hath no water.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the strong shall be as towe, and the maker thereof, as a sparke: and they shall both burne together, and none shall quench them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
