And he answered, Be it as thou hast said, that thou maiest know, that there is none like vnto the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So the frogges shall depart from thee, and from thine houses, and from thy seruantes, and from thy people: onely they shall remaine in the riuer.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cryed vnto the Lord concerning the frogges, which hee had sent vnto Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord did according to the saying of Moses: so the frogges died in the houses, in the townes, and in the fieldes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they gathered the together by heaps, and the land stanke of them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when Pharaoh sawe that hee had rest giuen him, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not vnto them, as the Lord had said.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Againe the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Stretche out the rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may bee turned to lyce throughout all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth: and lyce came vpon man and vpon beast: all the dust of the earth was lyce throughout all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Nowe the enchanters assaied likewise with their enchantments to bring forth lyce, but they could not. So the lyce were vpon man and vpon beast.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then saide the enchanters vnto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But Pharaohs heart remained obstinate, and hee hearkened not vnto them, as the Lord had said.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moreouer the Lord sayd to Moses, Rise vp earely in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh (lo, hee will come forth vnto the water) and say vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serue me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Els, if thou wilt not let my people goe, behold, I will send swarmes of flies both vpon thee, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thine houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shalbe full of swarmes of flies, and the ground also whereon they are.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But ye land of Goshe, where my people are, wil I cause to be wonderfull in that day, so that no swarmes of flies shalbe there, that thou maiest know that I am the Lord in the middes of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will make a deliuerance of my people from thy people: to morowe shall this miracle be.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the Lord did so: for there came great swarmes of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his seruants houses, so that through all the lande of Egypt, the earth was corrupt by the swarmes of flies.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and saide, Goe, doe sacrifice vnto your God in this lande.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But Moses answered, It is not meete to do so: for then we shoulde offer vnto the Lord our God that, which is an abomination vnto the Egyptians. Loe, can we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and they not stone vs?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Let vs go three dayes iourney in the desert, and sacrifice vnto the Lord our God, as he hath commanded vs.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice vnto the Lord your God in the wildernesse: but goe not farre away, pray for me.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said, Behold, I will go out from thee, and pray vnto the Lord, that the swarmes of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people to morowe: but let Pharaoh from hencefoorth deceiue no more, in not suffering the people to sacrifice vnto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed vnto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Lord did according to the saying of Moses, and the swarmes of flies departed from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people, and there remained not one.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Yet Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, and did not let the people goe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
