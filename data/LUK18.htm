And when his disciples sawe it, they rebuked them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Iesus called them vnto him, and said, Suffer the babes to come vnto mee, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto you, whosoeuer receiueth not the kingdome of God as a babe, he shall not enter therein.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then a certaine ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what ought I to doe, to inherite eternall life?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Iesus said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, saue one, euen God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou knowest the comandements, Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnes: Honour thy father and thy mother.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And hee saide, All these haue I kept from my youth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nowe when Iesus heard that, he saide vnto him, Yet lackest thou one thing. Sell all that euer thou hast, and distribute vnto the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come follow mee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But when he heard those things, he was very heauie: for he was marueilous riche.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when Iesus sawe him very sorowfull, he said, With what difficultie shall they that haue riches, enter into the kingdome of God!  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Surely it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, then for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then said they that heard it, And who then can be saued?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said, The things which are vnpossible with men, are possible with God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Peter said, Loe, we haue left all, and haue followed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children for the kingdome of Gods sake,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Which shall not receiue much more in this world, and in the world to come life euerlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Iesus tooke vnto him ye twelue, and said vnto them, Beholde, we goe vp to Hierusalem, and all things shalbe fulfilled to the Sonne of man, that are writttn by the Prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For he shall be deliuered vnto the Gentiles, and shalbe mocked, and shalbe spitefully entreated, and shalbe spitted on.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when they haue scourged him, they will put him to death: but the thirde day hee shall rise againe.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But they vnderstood none of these things, and this saying was hidde from them, neither perceiued they the things, which were spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And it came to passe, that as he was come neere vnto Iericho, a certaine blinde man sate by the way side, begging.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when he heard the people passe by, he asked what it meant.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they saide vnto him, that Iesus of Nazareth passed by.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then hee cried, saying, Iesus the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on me.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they which went before, rebuked him that he shoulde holde his peace, but he cried much more, O Sone of Dauid, haue mercie on me.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Iesus stoode stil, and commanded him to be brought vnto him. And when he was come neere, he asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Saying, What wilt thou that I doe vnto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receiue my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Iesus said vnto him, Receiue thy sight: thy faith hath saued thee.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then immediatly he receiued his sight, and followed him, praysing God: and all the people, when they sawe this, gaue praise to God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
