Whom if thou bringest on their iourney as it beseemeth according to God, thou shalt doe well,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Because that for his Names sake they went forth, and tooke nothing of the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>We therefore ought to receiue such, that we might be helpers to the trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I wrote vnto the Church: but Diotrephes which loueth to haue the preeminence among them, receiueth vs not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Wherefore if I come, I will call to your remembrance his deedes which he doeth, pratling against vs with malicious wordes, and not therewith content, neither he himselfe receiueth the brethren, but forbiddeth them that woulde, and thrusteth them out of the Church.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Beloued, follow not that which is euill, but that which is good: he that doeth well, is of God: but he that doeth euill, hath not seene God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Demetrius hath good report of al men, and of the trueth it selfe: yea, and wee our selues beare recorde, and ye know that our record is true.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I haue many things to write: but I will not with yncke and pen write vnto thee:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speake mouth to mouth. Peace be with thee. The friends salute thee. Greete the friends by name. </div><ul class='tnav'>
