 <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then I answered them, The worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Speake vnto the house of Israel, Thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I will pollute my Sanctuarie, euen the pride of your power, the pleasure of your eyes, and your hearts desire, and your sonnes, and your daughters whom ye haue left, shall fall by the sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And ye shall doe as I haue done: ye shall not couer your lippes, neither shall ye eate the bread of men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And your tyre shalbe vpon your heads, and your shooes vpon your feete: ye shall not mourne nor weepe, but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourne one toward another.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus Ezekiel is vnto you a signe: according to all that he hath done, ye shall do: and when this commeth, ye shall know that I am the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Also, thou sonne of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their power, ye ioy of their honor, ye pleasure of their eyes, and the desire of their heart, their sonnes and their daughters?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>That he that escapeth in that day, shall come vnto thee to tell thee that which hee hath heard with his eares?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speake, and be no more dumme, and thou shalt be a signe vnto them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
