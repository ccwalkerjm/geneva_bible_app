Woe vnto vs, for wee are destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>O Ierusalem, wash thine heart from wickednes, that thou maiest be saued: how long shall thy wicked thoughtes remaine within thee?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For a voyce declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Make ye mention of the heathen, and publish in Ierusalem, Beholde, the skoutes come from a farre countrey, and crie out against the cities of Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They haue compassed her about as the watchmen of the fielde, because it hath prouoked me to wrath, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thy wayes and thine inuentions haue procured thee these things, such is thy wickednesse: therefore it shall be bitter, therefore it shall perce vnto thine heart.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My bely, my bely, I am pained, euen at the very heart: mine heart is troubled within me: I cannot be still: for my soule hath heard the sounde of the trumpet, and the alarme of the battell.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Destruction vpon destruction is cryed, for the whole lande is wasted: suddenly are my tents destroyed, and my curtaines in a moment.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Howe long shall I see the standert, and heare the sounde of the trumpet?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For my people is foolish, they haue not knowen me: they are foolish children, and haue none vnderstanding: they are wise to doe euill, but to doe well they haue no knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I haue looked vpon the earth, and loe, it was without forme and voide: and to the heauens, and they had no light.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I behelde the mountaines: and loe, they trembled and all the hilles shooke.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I behelde, and loe, there was no man, and all the birdes of the heauen were departed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I behelde, and loe, the fruitfull place was a wildernesse, and all the cities thereof were broken downe at the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For thus hath the Lord saide, The whole lande shall be desolate: yet will I not make a full ende.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore shall the earth mourne, and the heauens aboue shall be darkened, because I haue pronounced it: I haue thought it, and will not repent, neither will I turne backe from it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The whole citie shall flee, for the noyse of the horsemen and bowemen: they shall goe into thickets, and clime vp vpon the rockes: euery citie shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when thou shalt be destroyed, what wilt thou doe? Though thou clothest thy selfe with skarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of golde, though thou paintest thy face with colours, yet shalt thou trimme thy selfe in vaine: for thy louers will abhorre thee and seeke thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For I haue heard a noyse as of a woman trauailing, or as one labouring of her first child, euen the voyce of the daughter Zion that sigheth and stretcheth out her handes: woe is me nowe: for my soule fainteth because of the murtherers. </div><ul class='tnav'>
