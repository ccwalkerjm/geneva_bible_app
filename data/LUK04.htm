 <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then he said vnto them, Ye will surely say vnto mee this prouerbe, Physician, heale thy selfe: whatsoeuer we haue heard done in Capernaum, doe it here likewise in thine owne countrey.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he saide, Verely I say vnto you, No Prophet is accepted in his owne countrey.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But I tell you of a trueth, many widowes were in Israel in the dayes of Elias, when heauen was shut three yeres and sixe moneths, when great famine was throughout all the land:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But vnto none of them was Elias sent, saue into Sarepta, a citie of Sidon, vnto a certaine widowe.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Also many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Eliseus the Prophet: yet none of them was made cleane, sauing Naaman the Syrian.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then all that were in the Synagogue, when they heard it, were filled with wrath,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And rose vp, and thrust him out of the citie, and led him vnto the edge of the hil, whereon their citie was built, to cast him downe headlong.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But he passed through the middes of them, and went his way,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And came downe into Capernaum a citie of Galile, and there taught them on the Sabbath dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they were astonied at his doctrine: for his worde was with authoritie.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an vncleane deuill, which cryed with a loude voyce,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Saying, Oh, what haue we to doe with thee, thou Iesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy vs? I know who thou art, euen the holy one of God.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him. Then the deuill throwing him in the middes of them, came out of him, and hurt him nothing at all.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So feare came on them all, and they spake among themselues, saying, What thing is this: for with authoritie and power he commaundeth the foule spirits, and they come out?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And ye fame of him spred abroad throughout all the places of the countrey round about.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he rose vp, and came out of the Synagogue, and entred into Simons house. And Simons wiues mother was taken with a great feuer, and they required him for her.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then he stoode ouer her, and rebuked the feuer, and it left her, and immediatly she arose, and ministred vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Now at the sunne setting, all they that had sicke folkes of diuers diseases, brought them vnto him, and he layd his hands on euery one of them, and healed them.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And deuils also came out of many, crying, and saying, Thou art that Christ that Sonne of God: but he rebuked them, and suffered them not to say that they knewe him to be that Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And when it was day, he departed, and went foorth into a desart place, and the people sought him, and came to him, and kept him that he should not depart from them.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>But he sayd vnto them, Surely I must also preach the kingdome of God to other cities: for therefore am I sent.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And hee preached in the Synagogues of Galile. </div><ul class='tnav'>
