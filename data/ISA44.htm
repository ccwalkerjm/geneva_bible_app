Feare not, O Iaakob, my seruaunt, and thou righteous, whome I haue chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For I will powre water vpon the thirstie, and floods vpon the drie grounde: I will powre my Spirit vpon thy seede, and my blessing vpon thy buddes.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they shall grow as among the grasse, and as the willowes by the riuers of waters.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>One shall say, I am the Lordes: another shalbe called by the name of Iaakob: and another shall subscribe with his hand vnto the Lord, and name himselfe by the name of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel and his redeemer, the Lord of hostes, I am the first, and I am the last, and without me is there no God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And who is like me, that shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order before me, since I appointed the ancient people? and what is at hand, and what things are to come? let them shewe vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Feare ye not, neither be afraide: haue not I tolde thee of olde, and haue declared it? you are euen my witnesses, whether there be a God beside me, and that there is no God that I knowe not.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>All they that make an image, are vanitie, and their delectable things shall nothing profite: and they are their owne witnesses, that they see not nor know: therefore they shalbe confounded.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who hath made a god, or molten an image, that is profitable for nothing?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Beholde, all that are of the fellowship thereof, shall be confounded: for the workemen themselues are men: let them all be gathered together, and stand vp, yet they shall feare, and be confounded together.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The smith taketh an instrument, and worketh in the coles, and facioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his armes: yea, he is an hungred, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The carpenter stretcheth out a line: he facioneth it with a red thread, he planeth it, and he purtreyeth it with the compasse, and maketh it after the figure of a man, and according to the beautie of a man that it may remaine in an house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He will hewe him downe cedars, and take the pine tree and the oke, and taketh courage among the trees of the forest: he planteth a firre tree, and the raine doeth nourish it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And man burneth thereof: for he will take thereof and warme himselfe: he also kindleth it and baketh bread, yet he maketh a god, and worshippeth it: he maketh it an idole and boweth vnto it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He burneth the halfe thereof euen in the fire, and vpon the halfe thereof he eateth flesh: he rosteth the roste and is satisfied: also he warmeth himselfe and sayth, Aha, I am warme, I haue bene at the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the residue thereof he maketh a god, euen his idole: he boweth vnto it, and worshippeth and prayeth vnto it, and sayeth, Deliuer me: for thou art my god.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They haue not knowen, nor vnderstand: for God hath shut their eyes that they cannot see, and their heartes, that they cannot vnderstand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor vnderstanding to say, I haue burnt halfe of it, euen in the fire, and haue baked bread also vpon the coles thereof: I haue rosted flesh, and eaten it, and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I bowe to the stocke of a tree?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He feedeth of ashes: a seduced heart hath deceiued him, that he cannot deliuer his soule, nor say, Is there not a lye in my right hand?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Remember these (O Iaakob and Israel) for thou art my seruant: I haue formed thee: thou art my seruant: O Israel forget me not.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I haue put away thy transgressions like a cloude, and thy sinnes, as a mist: turne vnto me, for I haue redeemed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Reioyce, ye heauens: for the Lord hath done it: shoute, ye lower partes of the earth: brast foorth into prayses, ye mountaines, O forest and euery tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Iaakob and will be glorified in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the wombe, I am the Lord, that made all things, that spred out the heauens alone, and stretched out the earth by my selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I destroy the tokens of ye southsayers, and make them that coniecture, fooles, and turne the wise men backwarde, and make their knowledge foolishnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He confirmeth the worde of his seruant and performeth the counsell of his messengers, saying to Ierusalem, Thou shalt bee inhabited: and to the cities of Iudah, Yee shall be built vp, and I will repayre the decayed places thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He saith to the deepe, Be drye and I will drye vp thy floods.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He saith to Cyrus, Thou art my shepheard: and he shall performe all my desire: saying also to Ierusalem, Thou shalt be built: and to the Temple, Thy foundation shall be surely layed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
