Doe men gather grapes of thornes? or figges of thistles?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So euery good tree bringeth foorth good fruite, and a corrupt tree bringeth forth euill fruite.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A good tree can not bring forth euil fruite: neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruite.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore by their fruites ye shall knowe them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Not euery one that sayeth vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doeth my Fathers will which is in heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, haue we not by thy Name prophecied? and by thy name cast out deuils? and by thy name done many great workes?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And then will I professe to them, I neuer knewe you: depart from me, ye that worke iniquitie.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Whosoeuer then heareth of mee these words, and doeth the same, I will liken him to a wise man, which hath builded his house on a rock:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the raine fell, and the floods came, and the windes blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it fell not: for it was grounded on a rocke.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But whosoeuer heareth these my wordes, and doeth them not, shall be likened vnto a foolish man, which hath builded his house vpon the sand:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the raine fell, and the floods came, and the windes blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it fell, and the fall thereof was great.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it came to passe, when Iesus had ended these wordes, the people were astonied at his doctrine.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For he taught them as one hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
