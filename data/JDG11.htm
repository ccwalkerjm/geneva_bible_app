So whomesoeuer the Lord our God driueth out before vs, them will we possesse.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And art thou nowe farre better then Balak the sonne of Zippor King of Moab? did he not striue with Israel and fight against them,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When Israel dwelt in Heshbon and in her townes, and in Aroer and in her townes, and in all the cities that are by the coastes of Arnon, three hundreth yeeres? why did ye not then recouer them in that space?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wherefore, I haue not offended thee: but thou doest me wrong to warre against me. The Lord the Iudge be iudge this day betweene the children of Israel, and the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Howbeit the King of the children of Ammon hearkened not vnto the wordes of Iphtah, which he had sent him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then the Spirite of the Lord came vpon Iphtah, and he passed ouer to Gilead and to Manasseh, and came to Mizpeh in Gilead, and from Mizpeh in Gilead he went vnto the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Iphtah vowed a vowe vnto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt deliuer the children of Ammon into mine handes,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then that thing that commeth out of the doores of mine house to meete me, when I come home in peace from the children of Ammon, shall be the Lordes, and I will offer it for a burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And so Iphtah went vnto the children of Ammon to fight against them, and the Lord deliuered them into his handes.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he smote them from Aroer euen till thou come to Minnith, twentie cities, and so foorth to Abel of the vineyardes, with an exceeding great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were humbled before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Nowe when Iphtah came to Mizpeh vnto his house, beholde, his daughter came out to meete him with timbrels and daunces, which was his onely childe: he had none other sonne, nor daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And when hee sawe her, hee rent his clothes, and saide, Alas my daughter, thou hast brought me lowe, and art of them that trouble me: for I haue opened my mouth vnto the Lord, and can not goe backe.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And she said vnto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth vnto the Lord, doe with me as thou hast promised, seeing that the Lord hath auenged thee of thine enemies the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Also she saide vnto her father, Doe thus much for me: suffer me two moneths, that I may goe to the mountaines, and bewaile my virginitie, I and my fellowes.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he sayde, Goe: and he sent her away two moneths: so she went with her companions, and lamented her virginitie vpon the moutaines.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And after the ende of two moneths, she turned againe vnto her father, who did with her according to his vowe which he had vowed, and she had knowen no man. and it was a custome in Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>The daughters of Israel went yere by yere to lament the daughter of Iphtah the Gileadite, foure dayes in a yeere. </div><ul class='tnav'>
