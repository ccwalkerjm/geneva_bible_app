children of Israel, that they receiue an offring for me: of euery man, whose heart giueth it freely, ye shall take the offring for me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And this is the offring which ye shall take of them, golde, and siluer, and brasse,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And blewe silke, and purple, and skarlet, and fine linnen, and goates heare,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And rammes skinnes coloured red, and the skinnes of badgers, and the wood Shittim,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Oyle for the light, spices for anoynting oyle, and for the perfume of sweete sauour,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Onix stones, and stones to be set in the Ephod, and in the brest plate.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Also they shall make me a Sanctuarie, that I may dwell among them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>According to all that I shewe thee, euen so shall ye make the forme of the Tabernacle, and the facion of all the instruments thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They shall make also an Arke of Shittim wood, two cubites and an halfe long, and a cubite and an halfe broade, and a cubite and an halfe hie.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And thou shalt ouerlay it with pure golde: within and without shalt thou ouerlay it, and shalt make vpon it a crowne of golde rounde about.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt cast foure rings of golde for it, and put them in the foure corners thereof: that is, two rings shalbe on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt make barres of Shittim wood, and couer them with golde.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then thou shalt put the barres in the rings by the sides of the Arke, to beare the Arke with them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The barres shalbe in the rings of the Arke: they shall not be taken away from it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So thou shalt put in the Arke the Testimonie which I shall giue thee.  <span class="verse"

Cherubims shall stretche their winges on hie, couering the Mercie seate with their winges, and their faces one to another: to the Mercie seate warde shall the faces of the Cherubims be.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou shalt put the Mercieseate aboue vpon the Arke, and in the Arke thou shalt put the Testimonie, which I will giue thee,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And there I will declare my selfe vnto thee, and from aboue ye Mercieseate betweene ye two Cherubims, which are vpon ye Arke of ye Testimonie, I wil tel thee al things which I wil giue thee in comandement vnto ye children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thou shalt also make a Table of Shittim wood, of two cubites long, and one cubite broade, and a cubite and an halfe hie:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And thou shalt couer it with pure gold, and make thereto a crowne of golde round about.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thou shalt also make vnto it a border of foure fingers roud about and thou shalt make a golden crowne round about the border thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>After, thou shalt make for it foure ringes of golde, and shalt put the rings in the foure corners that are in the foure feete thereof:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Ouer against the border shall the rings be for places for barres, to beare the Table.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And thou shalt make the barres of Shittim wood, and shalt ouerlay them with golde, that the Table may be borne with them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Thou shalt make also dishes for it, and incense cuppes for it, and couerings for it, and goblets, wherewith it shall be couered, euen of fine golde shalt thou make them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And thou shalt set vpon the Table shewe bread before me continually.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Also thou shalt make a Candlesticke of pure golde: of worke beaten out with the hammer shall the Candlesticke be made, his shaft, and his branches, his boules, his knops: and his floures shalbe of the same.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Six braunches also shall come out of the sides of it: three branches of the

the seuen lampes thereof: and the lampes thereof shalt thou put thereon, to giue light toward that that is before it.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Also the snuffers and snuffedishes thereof shalbe of pure golde.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Of a talent of fine gold shalt thou make it with all these instruments.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Looke
