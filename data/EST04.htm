Now I haue not bene called to come vnto the King these thirtie dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they certified Mordecai of Esters wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Mordecai saide, that they should answere Ester thus, Thinke not with thy selfe that thou shalt escape in the Kings house, more then all the Iewes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For if thou holdest thy peace at this time, comfort and deliuerance shall appeare to the Iewes out of another place, but thou and thy fathers house shall perish: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdome for such a time?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Ester commanded to answere Mordecai,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Goe, and assemble all the Iewes that are found in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and eate not, nor drinke in three dayes, day nor night. I also and my maydes will fast likewise, and so will I go in to the King, which is not according to the lawe: and if I perish, I perish.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Ester had commanded him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
