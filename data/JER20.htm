<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 20</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When Pashur, the sonne of Immer, the Priest, which was appointed gouernour in the house of the Lord, heard that Ieremiah prophecied these things,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then Pashur smote Ieremiah the Prophet, and put him in the stockes that were in the hie gate of Beniamin which was by the House of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And on the morning, Pashur brought Ieremiah out of the stockes. Then said Ieremiah vnto him, The Lord hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will make thee to be a terrour to thy self, and to al thy friends, and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall beholde it, and I will giue all Iudah into the hande of the King of Babel, and he shall cary them captiue into Babel, and shall slay them with the sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moreouer, I will deliuer all the substance of this citie, and all the labours thereof, and al the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the Kings of Iudah will I giue into the hande of their enemies, which shall spoyle them, and take them away and cary them to Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And thou Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house, shall go into captiuitie, and thou shalt come to Babel, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buryed there, thou and all thy friendes, to whome thou hast prophecied lyes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>O Lord, thou hast deceiued me, and I am deceiued: thou art stronger then I, and hast preuailed: I am in derision daily: euery one mocketh me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For since I spake, I cryed out of wrong, and proclaimed desolation: therefore the word of the Lord was made a reproche vnto me, and in derision daily.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speake any more in his Name. But his worde was in mine heart as a burning fire shut vp in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For I had heard the railing of many, and feare on euery side. Declare, said they, and wee wil declare it: all my familiars watched for mine halting, saying, It may be that he is deceiued: so we shall preuaile against him, and we shall execute our vengeance vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the Lord is with me like a mightie gyant: therefore my persecuters shall be ouerthrowen, and shall not preuaile, and shalbe greatly confounded: for they haue done vnwisely, and their euerlasting shame shall neuer be forgotten.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But, O Lord of hostes, that tryest the righteous, and seest the reines and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for vnto thee haue I opened my cause.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sing vnto the Lord, praise ye the Lord: for he hath deliuered the soule of the poore from the hande of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Cursed be the day wherein I was borne: and let not the day wherein my mother bare me, be blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Cursed be the man, that shewed my father, saying, A man child is borne vnto thee, and comforted him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And let that man be as the cities, which the Lord hath ouerturned and repented not: and let him heare the cry in the morning, and the showting at noone tide,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Because he hath not slaine me, euen from the wombe, or that my mother might haue bene my graue, or her wobe a perpetual conception.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>How is it, that I came forth of the wombe, to see labour and sorowe, that my dayes shoulde be consumed with shame? </div><ul class='tnav'>
