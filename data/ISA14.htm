and the gold thirsty Babel rested?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The Lord hath broken the rodde of the wicked, and the scepter of the rulers:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Which smote the people in anger with a continuall plague, and ruled the nations in wrath: if any were persecuted, he did not let.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The whole worlde is at rest and is quiet: they sing for ioye.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Also the firre trees reioyced of thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid downe, no hewer came vp against vs.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Hel beneath is mooued for thee to meete thee at thy comming, raising vp the deade for thee, euen all the princes of the earth, and hath raised from their thrones all the Kinges of the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All they shall crie, and saie vnto thee, Art thou become weake also as we? art thou become like vnto vs?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thy pompe is brought downe to ye graue, and the sounde of thy violes: the worme is spred vnder thee, and the wormes couer thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>How art thou fallen from heauen, O Lucifer, sonne of the morning? and cutte downe to the grounde, which didest cast lottes vpon the nations?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yet thou saidest in thine heart, I will ascende into heauen, and exalt my throne aboue beside the starres of God: I will sitte also vpon the mount of the Congregation in the sides of the North.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I wil ascend aboue ye height of the cloudes, and I will be like the most high.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But thou shalt bee brought downe to the graue, to the sides of the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They that see thee, shall looke vpon thee and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, and that did shake the kingdomes?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He made the worlde as a wildernesse, and destroied the cities thereof, and opened not the house of his prisoners.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>All the Kings of the nations, euen they all sleepe in glorie, euery one in his owne house.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But thou art cast out of thy graue like an abominable branch: like the raiment of those that are slaine, and thrust thorowe with a sword, which goe downe to the stones of the pit, as a carkeise troden vnder feete.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou shalt not be ioyned with them in the graue, because thou hast destroied thine owne lande, and slaine thy people: the seede of the wicked shall not be renoumed for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Prepare a slaughter for his children, for the iniquitie of their fathers: let them not rise vp nor possesse the land, nor fil the face of the world with enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For I wil rise vp against them (sayth the Lord of hostes) and will cut off from Babel the name and the remnant and the sonne, and the nephew, sayth the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I wil make it a possession to ye hedgehogge, and pooles of water, and I will sweepe it with the besome of destruction, sayeth the Lord of hostes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Lord of hostes hath sworne, saying, Surely like as I haue purposed, so shall it come to passe, and as I haue consulted, it shall stand:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>That I will breake to pieces Asshur in my land, and vpon my mountaines will I treade him vnder foote: so that his yoke shall depart from them, and his burden shall be taken from off their shoulder.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>This is the counsell that is consulted vpon the whole worlde, and this is the hande stretched out ouer all the nations,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Because the Lord of hostes hath determined it, and who shall disanull it? and his hande is stretched out, and who shall turne it away?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>In the yeere that King Ahaz died, was this burden.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Reioyce not, (thou whole Palestina) because the rod of him that did beat thee, is broken for out of the serpents roote shall come forth a cockatrise, and the fruit therof shalbe a firy flying serpent.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For the first borne of the poore shall be fed, and the needie shall lie downe in safetie: and I will kill thy roote with famine, and it shall slay thy remnant.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Howle, O gate, crie, O citie: thou whole lande of Palestina art dissolued, for there shall come from the North a smoke, and none shalbe alone, at his time appointed.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>What shall then one answere the messengers of the Gentiles? That the Lord hath stablished Zion, and the poore of his people shall trust in it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
