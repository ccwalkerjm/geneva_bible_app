Beholde, this is the description of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these are the measures of the Altar, after the cubites, the cubite is a cubite, and an had breadth, euen the bottome shalbe a cubite, and the breadth a cubite, and the border thereof by the edge thereof rounde about shalbe a spanne: and this shalbe the height of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And from the bottome which toucheth the ground to the lower piece shalbe two cubites: and the breadth one cubite, and from the litle piece to the great piece shalbe foure cubites, and the breadth one cubite.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the altar shalbe foure cubites, and from the altar vpward shalbe foure hornes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the altar shalbe twelue cubites long, and twelue broade, and fouresquare in the foure corners thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And ye frame shalbe foureteene cubites log, and fourteene broade in the fouresquare corners thereof, and the border about it shalbe halfe a cubite, and the bottome therof shalbe a cubite about, and the steps thereof shalbe turned towarde ye East.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said vnto me, Sone of man, thus saith ye Lord God, These are ye ordinances of ye altar in the day when they shall make it to offer the burnt offring thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt giue to the Priestes, and to the Leuites, that be of the seede of Zadok, which approch vnto me, to minister vnto me, saith the Lord God, a yong bullocke for a sinne offring.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the foure hornes of it, and on the foure corners of the frame, and vpon the border round about: thus shalt thou clense it, and reconcile it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt take the bullocke also of the sinne offring, and burne it in the appointed place of the house without the Sanctuarie.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the second day thou shalt offer an hee goat without blemish for a sinne offring, and they shall clense ye altar, as they did clense it with the bullocke.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When thou hast made an ende of clensing it, thou shalt offer a yong bullocke without blemish, and a ram out of the flocke without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And thou shalt offer them before ye Lord, and the Priestes shall cast salt vpon them, and they shall offer them for a burnt offring vnto ye Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Seuen dayes shalt thou prepare euery day an hee goate for a sinne offring: they shall also prepare a yong bullocke and a ramme out of the flocke, without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Thus shall they seuen dayes purifie the altar, and clense it, and consecrate it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when these dayes are expired, vpon the eight day and so forth, the Priests shall make your burnt offrings vpon the altar, and your peace offrings, and I will accept you, saith the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
