My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, and art so farre from mine health, and from the wordes of my roaring?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>O my God, I crie by day, but thou hearest not, and by night, but haue no audience.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But thou art holy, and doest inhabite the prayses of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didest deliuer them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They called vpon thee, and were deliuered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But I am a worme, and not a man: a shame of men, and the contempt of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>All they that see me, haue me in derision: they make a mowe and nod the head, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He trusted in the Lord, let him deliuer him: let him saue him, seeing he loueth him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But thou didest draw me out of ye wombe: thou gauest me hope, euen at my mothers breasts.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I was cast vpon thee, euen from ye wombe: thou art my God from my mothers belly.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Be not farre from me, because trouble is neere: for there is none to helpe me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Many yong bulles haue compassed me: mightie bulles of Bashan haue closed me about.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They gape vpon me with their mouthes, as a ramping and roaring lyon.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I am like water powred out, and all my bones are out of ioynt: mine heart is like waxe: it is molten in the middes of my bowels.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My strength is dryed vp like a potsheard, and my tongue cleaueth to my iawes, and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For dogges haue compassed me, and the assemblie of the wicked haue inclosed me: they perced mine hands and my feete.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I may tell all my bones: yet they beholde, and looke vpon me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They part my garments among them, and cast lottes vpon my vesture.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But be thou not farre off, O Lord, my strength: hasten to helpe me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Deliuer my soule from the sword: my desolate soule from the power of the dogge.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Saue me from the lyons mouth, and answere me in sauing me from the hornes of the vnicornes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I wil declare thy Name vnto my brethren: in the middes of the Congregation will I praise thee, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Prayse the Lord, ye that feare him: magnifie ye him, all the seede of Iaakob, and feare ye him, all the seede of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For he hath not despised nor abhorred ye affliction of the poore: neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he called vnto him, he heard.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>My prayse shalbe of thee in the great Congregation: my vowes will I perfourme before them that feare him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The poore shall eate and be satisfied: they that seeke after the Lord, shall prayse him: your heart shall liue for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>All the endes of the worlde shall remember themselues, and turne to the Lord: and all the kinreds of the nations shall worship before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For the kingdome is the Lords, and he ruleth among the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>All they that be fat in the earth, shall eate and worship: all they that go downe into the dust, shall bowe before him, euen he that cannot quicken his owne soule.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Their seede shall serue him: it shalbe counted vnto the Lord for a generation.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>They shall come, and shall declare his righteousnesse vnto a people that shall be borne, because he hath done it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
