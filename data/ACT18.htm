So he sailed from Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when hee came downe to Cesarea, he went vp to Hierusalem: and when he had saluted the Church, he went downe vnto Antiochia.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nowe when he had taried there a while, he departed, and went thorowe the countrey of Galatia and Phrygia by order, strengthening all the disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And a certaine Iewe named Apollos, borne at Alexandria, came to Ephesus, an eloquent man, and mightie in the Scriptures.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The same was instructed in the way of the Lord, and hee spake feruently in the Spirite, and taught diligently the things of the Lord, and knew but the baptisme of Iohn onely.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he began to speake boldely in the Synagogue. Whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they tooke him vnto them, and expounded vnto him the way of God more perfectly.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when hee was minded to goe into Achaia, the brethren exhorting him, wrote to the disciples to receiue him: and after hee was come thither, he holpe them much which had beleeued through grace.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For mightily hee confuted publikely the Iewes, with great vehemencie, shewing by the Scriptures, that Iesus was that Christ. </div><ul class='tnav'>
