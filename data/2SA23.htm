He that sate in the seate of wisedome, being chiefe of the princes, was Adino of Ezni, he slewe eight hundreth at one time.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And after him was Eleazar the sonne of Dodo, the sonne of Ahohi, one of the three worthies with Dauid, when they defied the Philistims gathered there to battel, when the men of Israel were gone vp.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He arose and smote the Philistims vntill his hande was wearie, and his hande claue vnto the sworde: and the Lord gaue great victorie the same day, and the people returned after him onely to spoyle.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>After him was Shammah the sonne of Age the Hararite: for the Philistims assembled at a towne, where was a piece of a fielde full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistims.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But he stoode in the middes of the fielde, and defended it, and slewe the Philistims: so the Lord gaue great victorie.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Afterward three of the thirtie captaines went downe, and came to Dauid in the haruest time vnto the caue of Adullam, and the hoste of the Philistims pitched in the valley of Rephaim.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Dauid was then in an holde, and the garison of ye Philistims was then in Beth-lehem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Dauid longed, and said, Oh, that one would giue me to drinke of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The the three mightie brake into the host of the Philistims, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem that was by the gate, and tooke and brought it to Dauid, who woulde not drinke thereof, but powred it for an offring vnto ye Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And said, O Lord, be it farre from me, that I should doe this. Is not this the blood of the men that went in ieopardie of their liues? therefore he woulde not drinke it.
