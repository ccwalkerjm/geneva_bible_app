Was hee not displeased with them that sinned, whose carkeises fell in the wildernes?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but vnto them that obeyed not?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So we see that they could not enter in, because of vnbeliefe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
