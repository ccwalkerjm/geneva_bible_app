Wherefore the inhabitants of the land are burned vp, and fewe men are left.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The wine faileth, the vine hath no might: all that were of merie heart, doe mourne.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The mirth of tabrets ceaseth: the noyse of them that reioyce, endeth: the ioye of the harpe ceaseth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They shall not drinke wine with mirth: strong drinke shall be bitter to them that drinke it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The citie of vanitie is broken downe: euery house is shut vp, that no man may come in.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is a crying for wine in the streetes: al ioy is darkened: the mirth of the world is gone away.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In the citie is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Surely thus shall it bee in the middes of the earth, among the people, as the shaking of an oliue tree, and as the grapes when the vintage is ended.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They shall lift vp their voyce: they shall shout for the magnificence of the Lord: they shall reioyce from the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Wherefore praise yee the Lord in the valleis, euen the Name of the Lord God of Israel, in the yles of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>From the vttermost part of the earth wee haue heard praises, euen glory to the iust, and I sayd, My leanesse, my leanesse, woe is mee: the transgressours haue offended: yea, the transgressours haue grieuously offended.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Feare, and the pitte, and the snare are vpon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And hee that fleeth from the noyse of the feare, shall fall into the pit: and he that commeth vp out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for the windowes from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth doe shake.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The earth is vtterly broken downe: the earth is cleane dissolued: the earth is mooued exceedingly.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The earth shall reele to and from like a drunken man, and shall be remooued like a tent, and the iniquitie thereof shall be heauie vpon it: so that it shall fall, and rise no more.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And in that day shall the Lord visite the hoste aboue that is on hie, euen the Kinges of the world that are vpon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they shall be gathered together, as the prisoners in the pit: and they shall be shut vp in the prison, and after many daies shall they be visited.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then the moone shall be abashed, and the sunne ashamed, when the Lord of hostes shall reigne in mount Zion and in Ierusalem: and glory shalbe before his ancient men. </div><ul class='tnav'>
