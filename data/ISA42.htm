These thinges will I doe vnto them, and not forsake them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They shall be turned backe: they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in grauen images, and say to the molten images, Yee are our gods.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Heare, ye deafe: and ye blinde, regarde, that ye may see.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Who is blinde but my seruaunt? or deafe as my messenger, that I sent? who is blind as the perfit, and blinde as the Lordes seruant?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Seeing many things, but thou keepest them not? opening the eares, but he heareth not?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Lord is willing for his righteousnesse sake that he may magnifie the Lawe, and exalt it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But this people is robbed and spoiled, and shalbe all snared in dungeons, and they shalbe hid in prison houses: they shall be for a pray, and none shall deliuer: a spoile, and none shall say, Restore.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Who among you shall hearken to this, and take heede, and heare for afterwardes?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Who gaue Iaakob for a spoyle, and Israel to the robbers? Did not ye Lord, because we haue sinned against him? for they woulde not walke in his waies, neither be obedient vnto his Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore hee hath powred vpon him his fierce wrath, and the strength of battell: and it set him on fire round about, and he knewe not, and it burned him vp, yet he considered not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
