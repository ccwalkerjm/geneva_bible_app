God will arise, and his enemies shalbe scattered: they also that hate him, shall flee before him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>As the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou driue them away: and as waxe melteth before the fire, so shall the wicked perish at the presence of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But the righteous shalbe glad, and reioyce before God: yea, they shall leape for ioye.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Sing vnto God, and sing prayses vnto his name: exalt him that rideth vpon the heauens, in his Name Iah, and reioyce before him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He is a Father of the fatherlesse, and a Iudge of the widowes, euen God in his holy habitation.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God maketh the solitarie to dwell in families, and deliuereth them that were prisoners in stocks: but the rebellious shall dwell in a dry land.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people: when thou wentest through the wildernesse, (Selah)  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The earth shooke, and the heauens dropped at the presence of this God: euen Sinai was moued at the presence of God, euen the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou, O God, sendest a gracious raine vpon thine inheritance, and thou didest refresh it when it was wearie.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thy Congregation dwelled therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodnesse prepared it for the poore.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Lord gaue matter to the women to tell of the great armie.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Kings of the armies did flee: they did flee, and she that remained in the house, deuided the spoyle.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Though ye haue lien among pots, yet shall ye be as the winges of a doue that is couered with siluer, and whose fethers are like yelowe golde.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When the Almightie scattered Kings in it, it was white as the snowe in Zalmon.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The mountaine of God is like the mountaine of Bashan: it is an high Mountaine, as mount Bashan.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Why leape ye, ye high mountaines? as for this Mountaine, God deliteth to dwell in it: yea, the Lord will dwell in it for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The charets of God are twentie thousande thousand Angels, and the Lord is among them, as in the Sanctuarie of Sinai.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou art gone vp on high: thou hast led captiuitie captiue, and receiued giftes for men: yea, euen the rebellious hast thou led, that the Lord God might dwell there.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Praysed be the Lord, euen the God of our saluation, which ladeth vs dayly with benefites. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is our God, euen the God that saueth vs: and to the Lord God belong the issues of death.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Surely God will wound the head of his enemies, and the hearie pate of him that walketh in his sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Lord hath sayde, I will bring my people againe from Bashan: I will bring them againe from the depths of the Sea:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That thy foote may bee dipped in blood, and the tongue of thy dogges in the blood of the enemies, euen in it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They haue seene, O God, thy goings, the goings of my God, and my King, which art in the Sanctuarie.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The singers went before, the players of instruments after: in the middes were the maides playing with timbrels.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Praise yee God in the assemblies, and the Lord, ye that are of the fountaine of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>There was litle Beniamin with their ruler, and the princes of Iudah with their assemblie, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thy God hath appointed thy strength: stablish, O God, that, which thou hast wrought in vs,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Out of thy Temple vpon Ierusalem: and Kings shall bring presents vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Destroy the company of the spearemen, and multitude of the mightie bulles with the calues of the people, that tread vnder feete pieces of siluer: scatter the people that delite in warre.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then shall the princes come out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall hast to stretche her hands vnto God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Sing vnto God, O yee kingdomes of the earth: sing praise vnto the Lord, (Selah)  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>To him that rideth vpon ye most high heauens, which were from the beginning: beholde, he will send out by his voice a mightie sound.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Ascribe the power to God: for his maiestie is vpon Israel, and his strength is in the cloudes.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>O God, thou art terrible out of thine holie places: the God of Israel is hee that giueth strength and power vnto the people: praised be God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
