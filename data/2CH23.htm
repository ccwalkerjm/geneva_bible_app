And Iehoiada and his sonnes anoynted him, and sayd, God saue the King.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when Athaliah heard the noyse of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when she looked, beholde, the King stoode by his pillar at the entring in, and the princes and the trumpets by the King, and all the people of the land reioyced, and blew the trumpets, and the singers were with instruments of musike, and they that could sing prayse: then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, treason.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Iehoiada the Priest brought out the captaines of hundreths that were gouernours of the hoste, and said vnto them, Haue her foorth of the ranges, and he that followeth her, let him dye by the sword: for the Priest had said, Slay her not in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So they layde hands on her: and when she was come to the entring of the horsegate by the Kings house, they slew her there.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Iehoiada made a couenant betweene him, and all the people, and the King, that they would be the Lords people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And all the people went to the house of Baal, and destroyed, and brake his altars and his images, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Iehoiada appointed officers for the house of the Lord, vnder the handes of the Priestes and Leuites, whome Dauid had distributed for the house of the Lord, to offer burnt offrings vnto the Lord, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with reioycing and singing by the appoyntment of Dauid.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he set porters by the gates of ye house of the Lord, that none that was vncleane in any thing, should enter in.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he tooke the captaines of hundreths, and the noble men, and the gouernours of the people, and all the people of the land, and he caused the King to come downe out of the house of the Lord, and they went thorowe the hie gate of the Kings house, and set the King vpon the throne of the kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then all the people of the land reioyced, and the citie was quiet, after that they had slaine Athaliah with the sword. </div><ul class='tnav'>
