<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then hee entred into a shippe, and passed ouer, and came into his owne citie.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And loe, they brought to him a man sicke of the palsie, laid on a bed. And Iesus seeing their faith, saide to the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, be of good comfort: thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And beholde, certaine of the Scribes saide with themselues, This man blasphemeth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But when Iesus saw their thoughts, he said, Wherefore thinke yee euil things in your hearts?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For whether is it easier to say, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, or to say, Arise, and walke?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And that ye may knowe that the Sonne of man hath authoritie in earth to forgiue sinnes, (then saide he vnto the sicke of the palsie,) Arise, take vp thy bed, and goe to thine house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And hee arose, and departed to his owne house.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So when the multitude sawe it, they marueiled, and glorified God, which had giuen such authoritie to men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And as Iesus passed foorth from thence, hee sawe a man sitting at the custome, named Matthewe, and saide to him, Followe me. And he arose, and followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it came to passe, as Iesus sate at meate in his house, beholde, many Publicanes and sinners, that came thither, sate downe at the table with Iesus and his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when the Pharises sawe that, they saide to his disciples, Why eateth your master with Publicanes and sinners?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Nowe when Iesus heard it, hee sayde vnto them, The whole neede not a Physition, but they that are sicke.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But goe yee and learne what this is, I will haue mercie, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then came the disciples of Iohn to him, saying, Why doe we and the Pharises fast oft, and thy disciples fast not?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Iesus saide vnto them, Can the children of the marriage chamber mourne as long as the bridegrome is with them? But the daies will come, when the bridegrome shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Moreouer no man pieceth an olde garment with a piece of newe cloth: for that that should fill it vp, taketh away from the garment, and the breach is worse.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Neither doe they put newe wine into olde vessels: for then the vessels would breake, and the wine woulde be spilt, and the vessels shoulde perish: but they put new wine into newe vessels, and so are both preserued.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>While hee thus spake vnto them, beholde, there came a certaine ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is nowe deceased, but come and laie thine hande on her, and shee shall liue.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Iesus arose and followed him with his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>(And beholde, a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelue yeres, came behinde him, and touched the hemme of his garment.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For shee saide in her selfe, If I may touche but his garment onely, I shalbe whole.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Iesus turned him about, and seeing her, did say, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole at that same moment.)  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nowe when Iesus came into the Rulers house, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making noise,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He said vnto them, Get you hence: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorne.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when the multitude were put foorth, hee went in and tooke her by the hande, and the maide arose.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And this bruite went throughout all that lande.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And as Iesus departed thence, two blinde men followed him, crying, and saying, O sonne of Dauid, haue mercie vpon vs.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when hee was come into the house, the blinde came to him, and Iesus saide vnto them, Beleeue yee that I am able to doe this? And they sayd vnto him, Yea, Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And their eyes were opened, and Iesus gaue them great charge, saying, See that no man knowe it.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But when they were departed, they spread abroad his fame throughout all that land.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And as they went out, beholde, they brought to him a domme man possessed with a deuill.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when the deuill was cast out, the domme spake: then the multitude marueiled, saying, The like was neuer seene in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the Pharises saide, He casteth out deuils, through the prince of deuils.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Iesus went about all cities and townes, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome, and healing euery sickenesse and euery disease among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But when he saw the multitude, he had compassion vpon them, because they were dispersed, and scattered abroade, as sheepe hauing no shepheard.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then saide he to his disciples, Surely the haruest is great, but the labourers are fewe.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Wherefore pray the Lord of the haruest, that he woulde sende foorth labourers into his haruest. </div><ul class='tnav'>
