Then is the slaunder of the crosse abolished.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Would to God they were euen cut off, which doe disquiet you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For brethren, ye haue bene called vnto libertie: onely vse not your libertie as an occasion vnto the flesh, but by loue serue one another.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For all the Lawe is fulfilled in one worde, which is this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If ye bite and deuoure one another, take heede least ye be consumed one of another.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then I say, Walke in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lustes of the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary one to another, so that ye can not doe the same things that ye would.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not vnder the Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Moreouer the workes of the flesh are manifest, which are adulterie, fornication, vncleannes, wantonnes,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Idolatrie, witchcraft, hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, seditions, heresies,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Enuie, murthers, drunkennesse, gluttonie, and such like, whereof I tell you before, as I also haue tolde you before, that they which doe such things, shall not inherite the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the fruite of the Spirit is loue, ioye, peace, long suffering, gentlenes, goodnes, fayth,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Meekenesse, temperancie: against such there is no lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For they that are Christes, haue crucified the flesh with the affections and the lustes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If we liue in the Spirit, let vs also walke in the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Let vs not be desirous of vaine glorie, prouoking one another, enuying one another. </div><ul class='tnav'>
