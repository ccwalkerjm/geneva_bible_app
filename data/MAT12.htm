And they asked him, saying, Is it lawfull to heale vpon a Sabbath day? that they might accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he said vnto the, What man shall there be among you, that hath a sheepe, and if it fal on a Sabbath day into a pit, doth not take it and lift it out?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>How much more then is a man better then a sheepe? therefore, it is lawfull to doe well on a Sabbath day.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then said he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it foorth, and it was made whole as the other.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the Pharises went out, and consulted against him, howe they might destroy him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But whe Iesus knew it, he departed thece, and great multitudes folowed him, and he healed the al,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And charged them in threatning wise, that they should not make him knowen,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold my seruant whom I haue chosen, my beloued in whom my soule deliteth: I wil put my Spirit on him, and he shall shewe iudgement to the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He shall not striue, nor crie, neither shall any man heare his voyce in the streetes.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A bruised reede shall he not breake, and smoking flaxe shall he not quenche, till he bring forth iudgement vnto victorie.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And in his Name shall the Gentiles trust.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then was brought to him one, possessed with a deuill, both blind, and dumme, and he healed him, so that he which was blind and dumme, both spake and saw.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And all the people were amased, and saide, Is not this that sonne of Dauid?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But when the Pharises heard it, they saide, This man casteth the deuils no otherwise out, but through Beelzebub the prince of deuils.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Iesus knew their thoughtes, and said to them, Euery kingdome deuided against it selfe, is brought to nought: and euery citie or house, deuided against it selfe, shall not stand.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So if Satan cast out Satan, he is deuided against himself: how shall then his kingdom endure?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Also if I through Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your iudges.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if I cast out deuils by ye Spirit of God, then is the kingdome of God come vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Els howe can a man enter into a strong mans house and spoyle his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then spoile his house.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Wherefore I say vnto you, euery sinne and blasphemie shalbe forgiuen vnto men: but the blasphemie against the holy Ghost shall not be forgiuen vnto men.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And whosoeuer shall speake a word against the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but whosoeuer shall speake against the holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen him, neither in this worlde, nor in the worlde to come.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Either make the tree good, and his fruite good: or els make the tree euill, and his fruite euil: for the tree is knowen by the fruite.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>O generations of vipers, howe can you speake good things, when ye are euill? For of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth foorth good things: and an euill man out of an euill treasure, bringeth forth euill things.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But I say vnto you, that of euery idle word that men shall speake, they shall giue account thereof at the day of iudgement.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For by thy wordes thou shalt be iustified, and by thy wordes thou shalt be condemned.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then answered certaine of ye Scribes and of the Pharises, saying, Master, we would see a signe of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But he answered and said to them, An euill and adulterous generation seeketh a signe, but no signe shall be giuen vnto it, saue that signe of the Prophet Ionas.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For as Ionas was three daies and three nights in the whales belly: so shall the Sonne of man be three daies and three nights in ye heart of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The men of Nineue shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and condemne it: for they repented at the preaching of Ionas: and behold, a greater then Ionas is here.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The Queene of the South shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for she came from the vtmost partes of the earth to heare the wisdome of Salomon: and beholde, a greater then Salomon is here.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Nowe when the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh throughout drie places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then he saith, I wil returne into mine house from whence I came: and when he is come, he findeth it emptie, swept and garnished.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then he goeth, and taketh vnto him seuen other spirites worse then himselfe, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the ende of that man is worse then the beginning. Euen so shall it be with this wicked generation.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>While he yet spake to ye multitude, beholde, his mother, and his brethren stood without, desiring to speake with him.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Then one said vnto him, Beholde, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speake with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>But he answered, and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And he stretched foorth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Beholde my mother and my brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>For whosoeuer shall doe my Fathers will which is in heauen, the same is my brother and sister and mother. </div><ul class='tnav'>
