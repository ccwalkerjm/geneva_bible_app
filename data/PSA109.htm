Holde not thy tongue, O God of my praise.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth full of deceite are opened vpon me: they haue spoken to me with a lying tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For my friendship they were mine aduersaries, but I gaue my selfe to praier.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they haue rewarded me euil for good, and hatred for my friendship.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Set thou the wicked ouer him, and let the aduersarie stand at his right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Whe he shalbe iudged, let him be condemned, and let his praier be turned into sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let his daies be fewe, and let another take his charge.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let his children be fatherlesse, and his wife a widowe.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let his children be vagabonds and beg and seeke bread, comming out of their places destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let the extortioner catch al that he hath, and let the strangers spoile his labour.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let there be none to extend mercie vnto him: neither let there be any to shewe mercie vpon his fatherlesse children.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let his posteritie be destroied, and in the generation following let their name be put out.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let the iniquitie of his fathers bee had in remembrance with the Lord: and let not the sinne of his mother be done away.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But let them alway be before the Lord, that he may cut off their memorial from ye earth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Because he remembred not to shew mercie, but persecuted the afflicted and poore man, and the sorowfull hearted to slay him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>As he loued cursing, so shall it come vnto him, and as he loued not blessing, so shall it be farre from him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As he clothed himselfe with cursing like a rayment, so shall it come into his bowels like water, and like oyle into his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Let it be vnto him as a garment to couer him, and for a girdle, wherewith he shalbe alway girded.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Let this be the rewarde of mine aduersarie from the Lord, and of them, that speake euill against my soule.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But thou, O Lord my God, deale with me according vnto thy Name: deliuer me, (for thy mercie is good)  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Because I am poore and needie, and mine heart is wounded within me.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I depart like the shadowe that declineth, and am shaken off as the grashopper.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>My knees are weake through fasting, and my flesh hath lost all fatnes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I became also a rebuke vnto them: they that looked vpon me, shaked their heads.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Helpe me, O Lord my God: saue me according to thy mercie.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they shall know, that this is thine hand, and that thou, Lord, hast done it.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Though they curse, yet thou wilt blesse: they shall arise and be confounded, but thy seruant shall reioyce.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Let mine aduersaries be clothed with shame, and let them couer themselues with their confusion, as with a cloke.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will giue thankes vnto the Lord greatly with my mouth and praise him among ye multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For he will stand at the right hand of the poore, to saue him from them that woulde condemne his soule. </div><ul class='tnav'>
