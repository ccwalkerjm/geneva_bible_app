elders of Israel to enquire of the Lord, and sate before me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then came the worde of the Lord vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Sonne of man, speake vnto the Elders of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye come to enquire of me? as I liue, sayth the Lord God, when I am asked, I wil not answer you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wilt thou iudge them, sonne of man? wilt thou iudge them? cause them to vnderstand the abominations of their fathers,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, In the day when I chose Israel, and lift vp mine hand vnto the seede of the house of Iaakob, and made my selfe knowen vnto them in the land of Egypt, when I lift vp mine hand vnto them, and sayd, I am the Lord your God,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the day that I lift vp mine hand vnto them to bring them forth of the land of Egypt, into a land that I had prouided for them, flowing with milke and hony which is pleasant among all lands,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then sayd I vnto them, Let euery man cast away the abominations of his eyes, and defile not your selues with the idols of Egypt: for I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But they rebelled against me, and would not heare me: for none cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idoles of Egypt: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them, and to accomplish my wrath against them in the mids of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But I had respect to my Name, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whome they were, and in whose sight I made my selfe knowen vnto them in bringing them forth of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Nowe I caried them out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wildernes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I gaue them my statutes, and declared my iudgements vnto them, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Moreouer I gaue them also my Sabbaths to be a signe betweene me and them, that they might knowe that I am the Lord, that sanctifie them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wildernes: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my iudgements, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them, and my Sabbaths haue they greatly polluted: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them in the wildernes to consume them,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I had respect to my Name, that it shoulde not bee polluted before the heathen in whose sight I brought them out.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yet neuerthelesse, I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes that I would not bring them into the lande, which I had giuen them, flowing with milke and hony, which was pleasant aboue all landes,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Because they cast away my iudgments, and walked not in my statutes, but haue polluted my Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idoles.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, mine eye spared them, that I would not destroye them, neither would I consume them in the wildernes.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I said vnto their children in the wildernes, Walke ye not in the ordinances of your fathers, neither obserue their maners, nor defile your selues with their idoles.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am the Lord your God: walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements and doe them,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And sanctifie my Sabbaths, and they shall bee a signe betweene mee and you, that ye may knowe that I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Notwithstanding the children rebelled against mee: they walked not in my statutes, nor kept my iudgements to doe them, which if a man doe, hee shall liue in them, but they polluted my Sabbaths: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them, and to accomplish my wrath against them in the wildernes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse I withdrew mine hand and had respect to my Name that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them foorth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countreys,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Because they had not executed my iudgements, but had cast away my statutes and had polluted my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers idoles.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Wherefore I gaue them also statutes that were not good, and iudgements, wherein they should not liue.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I polluted them in their owne giftes in that they caused to passe by the fire all that first openeth ye wombe, that I might destroy them, to the ende, that they might know that I am ye Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore, sonne of man, speake vnto the house of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Yet in this your fathers haue blasphemed me, though they had before grieuously transgressed against me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hand to giue it to them, then they saw euery hie hill, and all the thicke trees, and they offred there their sacrifices, and there they presented their offering of prouocation: there also they made their sweete sauour, and powred out there their drinke offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then I saide vnto them, What is the hie place whereunto ye goe? And the name thereof was called Bamah vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Wherefore, say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye not polluted after the maner of your fathers? and commit ye not whoredome after their abominations?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For when you offer your giftes, and make your sonnes to passe through the fire, you pollute your selues with all your idoles vnto this day: shall I answere you when I am asked, O house of Israel? As I liue, saith the Lord God, I wil not answere you when I am asked.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Neither shall that be done that commeth into your minde: for ye say, We wil be as the heathen, and as the families of the countreys, and serue wood, and stone.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>As I liue, saith the Lord God, I will surely rule you with a mightie hand, and with a stretched out arme, and in my wrath powred out,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And will bring you from the people, and will gather you out of the countreys, wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arme, and in my wrath powred out,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I will bring you into the wildernes of the people, and there wil I pleade with you face to face.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wildernes of the lande of Egypt, so will I pleade with you, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And I wil cause you to passe vnder the rod, and wil bring you into the bond of the couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And I wil chuse out from among you the rebels, and them that transgresse against mee: I will bring them out of the land where they dwel, and they shall not enter into the lande of Israel, and you shall knowe that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God, Goe you, and serue euery one his idole, seeing that ye will not obey me, and pollute mine holy Name no more with your giftes and with your idoles.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For in mine holy mountaine, euen in the hie mountaine of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel, and all in the lande, serue me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offrings and the first fruites of your oblations, with all your holy things.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I will accept your sweete sauour, when I bring you from the people, and gather you out of the countreys, wherein ye haue bene scattered, that I may be sanctified in you before ye heathen.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And ye shall knowe, that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hande to giue it to your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And there shall ye remember your wayes, and all your workes, wherein ye haue bene defiled, and ye shall iudge your selues worthy to be cut off, for all your euils, that ye haue committed.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And ye shall knowe, that I am the Lord, when I haue respect vnto you for my Names sake, and not after your wicked wayes, nor according to your corrupt workes, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Sonne of man, set thy face toward the way of Teman, and drop thy word toward the South, and prophecie towarde the forest of the fielde of the South,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And say to the forest of the South, Heare the worde of the Lord: thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall deuoure all the greene wood in thee, and all the drie wood: the continuall flame shall not bee quenched, and euery face from the South to the North shall be burnt therein.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord haue kindled it, and it shall not bee quenched. Then saide I, Ah Lord God, they say of me, Doeth not he speake parables? </div><ul class='tnav'>
