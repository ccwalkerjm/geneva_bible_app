I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmure against me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Tell them, As I liue (saith the Lord) I wil surely do vnto you, euen as ye haue spoken in mine eares.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Your carkeises shall fall in this wildernes, and all you that were counted through all your nombers, from twentie yeere olde and aboue, which haue murmured against me,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Ye shall not doubtles come into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hande, to make you dwell therein, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But your children, (which ye said shoulde be a pray) them will I bring in, and they shall knowe the lande which ye haue refused:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But euen your carkeises shall fall in this wildernes,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And your children shall wander in the wildernesse, fourtie yeeres, and shall beare your whoredomes, vntill your carkeises be wasted in the wildernesse.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>After the number of the dayes, in the which ye searched out the lande, euen fourtie dayes, euery day for a yeere, shall ye beare your iniquity, for fourtie yeeres, and ye shall feele my breach of promise.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I the Lord haue said, Certainely I will doe so to all this wicked company, that are gathered together against me: for in this wildernesse they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the men which Moses had sent to search the land (which, when they came againe, made all the people to murmure against him, and brought vp a slander vpon the lande)  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Euen those men that did bring vp that vile slander vpon the land, shall die by a plague before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, of those men that went to search the land, shall liue.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then Moses tolde these sayings vnto all the children of Israel, and the people sorowed greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And they rose vp earely in the morning, and gate them vp into the toppe of the mountaine, saying, Loe, we be readie, to goe vp to the place which the Lord hath promised: for wee haue sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>But Moses said, Wherefore transgresse yee thus the commandement of the Lord? it will not so come well to passe.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Goe not vp (for the Lord is not among you) lest ye be ouerthrowe before your enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sworde: for in as much as ye are turned away from the Lord, the Lord also will not be with you.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Yet they presumed obstinately to goe vp to the top of the mountaine: but the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, and Moses departed not out of the campe.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites, which dwelt in that mountaine, came downe and smote them, and consumed them vnto Hormah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
