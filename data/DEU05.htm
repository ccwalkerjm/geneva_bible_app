for this great fire wil consume vs: if we heare ye voyce of the Lord our God any more, we shall dye.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For what flesh was there euer, that heard the voyce of the liuing God speaking out of the middes of the fire as we haue, and liued?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Go thou neere and heare all that the Lord our God saith: and declare thou vnto vs all that the Lord our God saith vnto thee, and we will heare it, and doe it.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the Lord heard the voyce of your wordes, when ye spake vnto me: and the Lord sayd vnto me, I haue heard the voyce of ye wordes of this people, which they haue spoken vnto thee: they haue well sayd, all that they haue spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Oh that there were such an heart in them to feare me, and to keepe all my commandements alway: that it might go well with them, and with their children for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Go, say vnto them, Returne you into your tentes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But stand thou here with me, and I wil tell thee all the commandements, and the ordinances, and the lawes, which thou shalt teach them: that they may doe them in the land which I giue them to possesse it.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Take heede therefore, that ye doe as the Lord your God hath commanded you: turne not aside to the right hand nor to the left,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But walke in all the wayes which the Lord your God hath commanded you, that ye may liue, and that it may goe well with you: and that ye may prolong your dayes in the land which ye shall possesse. </div><ul class='tnav'>
