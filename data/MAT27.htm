But they sayde, What is that to vs? see thou to it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when hee had cast downe the siluer pieces in the Temple, hee departed, and went, and hanged himselfe.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the chiefe Priestes tooke the siluer pieces, and sayde, It is not lawfull for vs to put them into the treasure, because it is the price of bloud.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they tooke counsell, and bought with them a potters fielde, for the buriall of strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Wherefore that field is called, The field of bloud, vntill this day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>(Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremias the Prophet, saying, And they tooke thirtie siluer pieces, ye price of him that was valued, whom they of ye children of Israel valued.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they gaue them for the potters fielde, as the Lord appointed me.)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Iesus stood before ye gouernour, and the gouernour asked him, saying, Art thou that King of the Iewes? Iesus said vnto him, Thou sayest it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when he was accused of the chiefe Priestes, and Elders, he answered nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then saide Pilate vnto him, Hearest thou not howe many things they lay against thee?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But he answered him not to one worde, in so much that the gouernour marueiled greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nowe at the feast, the gouernour was wont to deliuer vnto the people a prisoner whom they would.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When they were then gathered together, Pilate said vnto the, Whether will ye that I let loose vnto you Barabbas, or Iesus which is called Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>(For he knewe well, that for enuie they had deliuered him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Also when he was set downe vpon the iudgement seate, his wife sent to him, saying, Haue thou nothing to do with that iust man: for I haue suffered many things this day in a dreame by reason of him.)  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the chiefe Priestes and the Elders had persuaded the people that they shoulde aske Barabbas, and should destroy Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the gouernour answered, and said vnto them, Whether of the twaine will ye that I let loose vnto you? And they said, Barabbas.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Pilate said vnto them, What shall I do then with Iesus, which is called Christ? They all said to him, Let him be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then saide the gouernour, But what euill hath he done? Then they cryed the more, saying, Let him be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When Pilate saw that he auailed nothing, but that more tumult was made, he tooke water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this iust man: looke you to it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then answered all the people, and saide, His bloud be on vs, and on our children.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Thus let he Barabbas loose vnto them, and scourged Iesus, and deliuered him to be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the souldiers of the gouernour tooke Iesus into the common hall, and gathered about him the whole band,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they stripped him, and put about him a skarlet robe,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And platted a crowne of thornes, and put it vpon his head, and a reede in his right hand, and bowed their knees before him, and mocked him, saying, God saue thee King of the Iewes,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And spitted vpon him, and tooke a reede, and smote him on the head.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Thus when they had mocked him, they tooke the robe from him, and put his owne rayment on him, and led him away to crucifie him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they compelled to beare his crosse.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when they came vnto the place called Golgotha, (that is to say, the place of dead mens skulles)  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They gaue him vineger to drinke, mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drinke.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, and did cast lottes, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, They deuided my garments among them, and vpon my vesture did cast lottes.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they sate, and watched him there.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They set vp also ouer his head his cause written, THIS IS IESVS THE KING OF THE IEVVES.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And there were two theeues crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they that passed by, reuiled him, wagging their heades,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And saying, Thou that destroyest ye Temple, and buildest it in three dayes, saue thy selfe: if thou be ye Sonne of God, come downe from ye crosse.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Likewise also the hie Priests mocking him, with the Scribes, and Elders, and Pharises, said,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>He saued others, but he cannot saue him selfe: if he be ye King of Israel, let him now come downe from ye crosse, and we will beleeue in him.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>He trusted in God, let him deliuer him nowe, if he will haue him: for he saide, I am the Sonne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>The selfe same thing also ye theeues which were crucified with him, cast in his teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Now from ye sixt houre was there darkenesse ouer all the land, vnto the ninth houre.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And about ye ninth houre Iesus cryed with a loud voyce, saying, Eli, Eli, lamasabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And some of them that stoode there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elias.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And straightway one of them ran, and tooke a spondge, and filled it with vineger, and put it on a reede, and gaue him to drinke.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Other said, Let be: let vs see, if Elias wil come and saue him.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then Iesus cryed againe with a loude voyce, and yeelded vp the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And behold, the vayle of the Temple was rent in twaine, from the top to the bottome, and the earth did quake, and the stones were cloue.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And the graues did open themselues, and many bodies of the Saintes, which slept, arose,  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And came out of the graues after his resurrection, and went into the holy citie, and appeared vnto many.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>When the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Iesus, saw the earthquake, and the thinges that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truely this was the Sonne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And many women were there, beholding him a farre off, which had folowed Iesus from Galile, ministring vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Among whom was Marie Magdalene, and Marie the mother of Iames, and Ioses, and the mother of Zebedeus sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And when the euen was come, there came a riche man of Arimathea, named Ioseph, who had also himselfe bene Iesus disciple.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>He went to Pilate, and asked ye body of Iesus. Then Pilate commanded ye body to be deliuered.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>So Ioseph tooke the body, and wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth,  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And put it in his new tombe, which he had hewen out in a rocke, and rolled a great stone to the doore of the sepulchre, and departed.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And there was Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie sitting ouer against the sepulchre.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Nowe the next day that followed the Preparation of the Sabbath, the hie Priestes and Pharises assembled to Pilate,  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And said, Syr, we remember that that deceiuer saide, while he was yet aliue, Within three dayes I will rise.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Command therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure vntill the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steale him away, and say vnto the people, He is risen from the dead: so shall the last errour be worse then the first.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then Pilate saide vnto them, Ye haue a watch: goe, and make it sure as ye knowe.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And they went, and made the sepulchre sure with the watch, and sealed the stone. </div><ul class='tnav'>
