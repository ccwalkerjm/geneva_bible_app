Though one crie vnto him, yet can he not answere, nor deliuer him out of his tribulation.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remember this, and be ashamed: bring it againe to minde, O you transgressers.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none other God, and there is nothing like me,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Which declare the last thing from the beginning: and from of olde, the things that were not done, saying, My counsell shall stand, and I will doe whatsoeuer I will.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I call a birde from the East, and the man of my counsell from farre: as I haue spoken, so will I bring it to passe: I haue purposed it, and I will doe it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Heare me, ye stubburne hearted, that are farre from iustice.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I bring neere my iustice: it shall not be farre off, and my saluation shall not tarie: for I wil giue saluation in Zion, and my glory vnto Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
