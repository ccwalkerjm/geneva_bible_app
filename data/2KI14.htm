 <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Amaziah would not heare: therefore Iehoash King of Israel went vp: and he and Amaziah King of Iudah sawe one another in the face at Beth-shemesh which is in Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Iudah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fledde euery man to their tents.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But Iehoash King of Israel tooke Amaziah King of Iudah, the sonne of Iehoash the sonne of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Ierusalem, and brake downe the wall of Ierusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, foure hundreth cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he tooke all the gold and siluer, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the Kings house, and the children that were in hostage, and returned to Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Concerning the rest of the acts of Iehoash which he did and his valiant deedes, and how he fought with Amaziah King of Iudah, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Iehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried at Samaria among the Kings of Israel: and Ieroboam his sonne reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Amaziah the sonne of Ioash King of Iudah, liued after the death of Iehoash sonne of Iehoahaz King of Israel fifteene yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Concerning the rest of the actes of Amaziah, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But they wrought treason against him in Ierusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish, and slewe him there.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Ierusalem with his fathers in the citie of Dauid.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then all the people of Iudah tooke Azariah which was sixteene yeere olde, and made him King for his father Amaziah.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He built Elath, and restored it to Iudah, after that the King slept with his fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In the fifteenth yeere of Amaziah the sonne of Ioash King of Iudah, was Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash made King ouer Israel in Samaria, and reigned one and fourtie yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he did euill in the sight of the Lord: for he departed not from all the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He restored the coast of Israel, from the entring of Hamath, vnto the Sea of the wildernesse, according to the worde of the Lord God of Israel, which he spake by his seruant Ionah the sonne of Amittai the Prophet, which was of Gath Hepher.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For the Lord saw the exceeding bitter affliction of Israel, so that there was none shutte vp, nor any left, neyther yet any that could helpe Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Yet the Lord had not decreed to put out the name of Israel from vnder the heauen: therefore he preserued them by the hand of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Concerning the rest of the actes of Ieroboam, and all that he did, and his valiant deedes, and how he fought, and how he restored Damascus, and Hamath to Iudah in Israel, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So Ieroboam slept with his fathers, euen with the Kings of Israel, and Zachariah his sonne reigned in his steade. </div><ul class='tnav'>
