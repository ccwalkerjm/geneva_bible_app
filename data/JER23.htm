Who hath marked his worde and heard it?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Beholde, the tempest of the Lord goeth forth in his wrath, and a violent whirlewinde shall fall downe vpon the head of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The anger of the Lord shall not returne vntill he haue executed, and till he haue perfourmed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter dayes ye shall vnderstande it plainely.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I haue not sent these prophets, sayth the Lord, yet they ranne; I haue not spoken to them, and yet they prophecied.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But if they had stande in my counsell, and had declared my words to my people, then they should haue turned them from their euill way, and from the wickednesse of their inuentions.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Am I a God at hande, saith the Lord, and not a God farre off?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Can any hide him selfe in secrete places, that I shall not see him, sayth the Lord? Do not I fill heauen and earth, saieth the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I haue heard what the prophets said, that prophecie lies in my Name, saying, I haue dreamed, I haue dreamed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Howe long? Doe the prophets delite to prophecie lies, euen prophecying the deceit of their owne heart?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thinke they to cause my people to forget my Name by their dreames, which they tell euery man to his neyghbour, as their forefathers haue forgotten my Name for Baal?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The prophet that hath a dreame, let him tell a dreame, and hee that hath my worde, let him speake my worde faithfully: what is the chaffe to the wheate, sayth the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Is not my word euen like a fire, sayeth the Lord? and like an hammer, that breaketh the stone?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore beholde, I will come against the prophets, saieth the Lord, that steale my word euerie one from his neighbour.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Beholde, I will come against the prophets, saith the Lord, which haue sweete tongues, and say, He saith.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Beholde, I will come against them that prophecie false dreames, saith the Lord, and doe tell them, and cause my people to erre by their lies, and by their flatteries, and I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they bring no profite vnto this people, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when this people, or the prophet, or a Priest shall aske thee, saying, What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt then say vnto them, What burden? I will euen forsake you, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the prophet, or the Priest, or the people that shall say, The burden of the Lord, I will euen visite euerie such one, and his house.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Thus shall yee say euery one to his neighbour, and euerie one to his brother, What hath the Lord answered? and what hath the Lord spoken?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the burden of the Lord shall yee mention no more: for euery mans worde shall bee his burden: for ye haue peruerted the words of the liuing God, the Lord of hostes our God.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thus shalt thou say to the Prophet, What hath the Lord answered thee? and what hath the Lord spoken?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And if you say, The burden of the Lord, Then thus saith the Lord, Because yee say this word, The burden of the Lord, and I haue sent vnto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Therefore beholde, I, euen I will vtterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the citie that I gaue you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And will bring an euerlasting reproche vpon you, and a perpetual shame which shall neuer be forgotten. </div><ul class='tnav'>
