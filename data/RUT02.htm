<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Naomis husband had a kinsman, one of great power of the familie of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Ruth ye Moabitesse said vnto Naomi, I pray thee, Let mee goe to the fielde, and gather eares of corne after him, in whose sight I finde fauour. And she said vnto her, Goe my daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And she went, and came and gleaned in the fielde after the reapers, and it came to passe, that she met with the portion of the fielde of Boaz, who was of the familie of Elimelech.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and saide vnto the reapers, The Lord be with you: and they answered him, The Lord blesse thee.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then saide Boaz vnto his seruant that was appointed ouer the reapers, Whose maide is this?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the seruant that was appointed ouer the reapers, answered, and said, It is the Moabitish maide, that came with Naomi out of the countrey of Moab:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And shee saide vnto vs, I pray you, let mee gleane and gather after the reapers among the sheaues: so shee came, and hath continued from that time in the morning vnto now, saue that she taried a litle in the house.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then said Boaz vnto Ruth, Hearest thou, my daughter? goe to none other fielde to gather, neither goe from hence: but abide here by my maydens.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reape, and goe thou after the maidens. Haue I not charged the seruants, that they touche thee not? Moreouer whe thou art a thirst, go vnto ye vessels, and drinke of that which ye seruants haue drawen.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then shee fell on her face, and bowed her selfe to the ground, and said vnto him, How haue I found fauour in thine eyes, that thou shouldest know me, seeing I am a stranger?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Boaz answered, and said vnto her, All is told and shewed me that thou hast done vnto thy mother in lawe, since the death of thine husband, and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and ye land where thou wast borne, and art come vnto a people which thou knewest not in time past.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Lord recompense thy worke, and a ful reward be giuen thee of the Lord God of Israel, vnder whose wings thou art come to trust.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then she saide, Let me finde fauour in thy sight, my lord: for thou hast comforted mee, and spoken comfortably vnto thy mayde, though I be not like to one of thy maydes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Boaz said vnto her, At the meale time come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dippe thy morsell in the vineger. And she sate beside the reapers, and hee reached her parched corne: and shee did eate, and was sufficed, and left thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when she arose to gleane, Boaz commanded his seruants, saying, Let her gather among the sheaues, and doe not rebuke her.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Also let fall some of the sheaues for her, and let it lie, that she may gather it vp, and rebuke her not.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So she gleaned in the fielde vntill euening, and she thresshed that shee had gathered, and it was about an Ephah of barly.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And she tooke it vp, and went into the citie, and her mother in law saw what she had gathered: Also she tooke foorth, and gaue to her that which she had reserued, when she was sufficed.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then her mother in lawe saide vnto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he, that knewe thee. And she shewed her mother in lawe, with whome she had wrought, and saide, The mans name, with whom I wrought to day, is Boaz.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Naomi said vnto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the Lord: for he ceaseth not to doe good to the liuing and to the dead. Againe Naomi saide vnto her, The man is neere vnto vs, and of our affinitie.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ruth the Moabitesse said, He said also certainely vnto mee, Thou shalt be with my seruants, vntill they haue ended all mine haruest.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Naomi answered vnto Ruth her daughter in lawe, It is best, my daughter, that thou goe out with his maides, that they meete thee not in an other fielde.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then she kept her by the maides of Boaz, to gather vnto the end of barly haruest, and of wheate haruest, and dwelt with her mother in lawe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
