And I answered, I see a flying booke: the length thereof is twentie cubites, and the breadth thereof tenne cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then said he vnto me, This is the curse that goeth foorth ouer the whole earth: for euery one that stealeth, shalbe cut off aswell on this side, as on that: and euery one that sweareth, shall be cut off aswell on this side, as on that.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thiefe, and into the house of him, that falsely sweareth by my Name: and it shall remaine in the middes of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and stones thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the Angel that talked with me, went foorth, and said vnto me, Lift vp now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth foorth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I saide, What is it? And hee sayde, This is an Ephah that goeth foorth.
