Feare ye not the reproche of men, neither be ye afraide of their rebukes.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the mothe shall eate them vp like a garment, and the worme shall eate them like wool: but my righteousnesse shalbe for euer, and my saluation from generation to generation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Rise vp, rise vp, and put on strength, O arme of the Lord: rise vp as in the olde time in the generations of the worlde. Art not thou the same, that hath cutte Rahab, and wounded the dragon?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Art not thou the same, which hath dried the Sea, euen the waters of the great deepe, making the depth of the Sea a way for the redeemed to passe ouer?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall returne, and come with ioy vnto Zion, and euerlasting ioy shalbe vpon their head: they shall obtaine ioy, and gladnesse: and sorow and mourning shall flee away.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I, euen I am he, that comfort you. Who art thou, that thou shouldest feare a mortall man, and the sonne of man, which shalbe made as grasse?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath spred out the heauens, and layde the foundations of the earth? and hast feared continually all the day, because of the rage of the oppressour, which is readie to destroy? Where is now the rage of the oppressour?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The captiue hasteneth to be loosed, and that hee should not die in the pitte, nor that his bread should faile.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I am the Lord thy God that deuided the Sea, when his waues roared: the Lord of hostes is his Name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I haue put my wordes in thy mouth, and haue defended thee in the shadowe of mine hand, that I may plant the heauens, and lay the foundation of the earth, and say vnto Zion, Thou art my people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Awake, awake, and stande vp, O Ierusalem, which hast drunke at the hande of the Lord the cup of his wrath: thou hast drunken the dregges of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is none to guide her among all the sonnes, whome she hath brought foorth: there is none that taketh her by the hand of all the sonnes that she hath brought vp.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>These two thinges are come vnto thee: who will lament thee? desolation and destruction and famine, and the sworde: by whome shall I comfort thee?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thy sonnes haue fainted, and lye at the head of all the streetes as a wilde bull in a nette, and are full of the wrath of the Lord, and rebuke of thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore heare nowe this, thou miserable and drunken, but not with wine.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus saith thy Lord God, euen God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Beholde, I haue taken out of thine hande the cuppe of trembling, euen the dregges of the cuppe of my wrath: thou shalt drinke it no more.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But I will put it into their hande that spoile thee: which haue said to thy soule, Bowe downe, that wee may goe ouer, and thou hast layde thy bodie as the grounde, and as the streete to them that went ouer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
