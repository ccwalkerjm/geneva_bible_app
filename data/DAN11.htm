<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Also I, in ye first yere of Darius of ye Medes, euen I stood to incourage and to strengthen him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And now wil I shew thee ye trueth, Behold, there shall stand vp yet three Kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be farre richer then they all: and by his strength, and by his riches he shall stirre vp all against the realme of Grecia.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But a mightie King shall stand vp, that shall rule with great dominion, and doe according to his pleasure.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when he shall stand vp, his kingdome shall be broken, and shall be deuided towarde the foure windes of heauen: and not to his posteritie, nor according to his dominion, which he ruled: for his kingdome shall be pluckt vp, euen to be for others besides those.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And ye King of ye South shalbe mightie, and one of his princes, and shall preuaile against him, and beare rule: his dominio shalbe a great dominion.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And in the ende of yeeres they shalbe ioyned together: for the Kings daughter of ye South shall come to the King of the North to make an agreement, but she shall not reteine the power of the arme, neither shall he continue, nor his arme: but she shall be deliuered to death, and they that brought her, and he that begate her, and he that comforted her in these times.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But out of the bud of her rootes shall one stand vp in his stead, which shall come with an armie, and shall enter into the fortresse of the King of the North, and doe with them as he list, and shall preuaile,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And shall also carie captiues into Egypt their gods with their molten images, and with their precious vessels of siluer and of golde, and he shall continue more yeeres then the King of the North.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So the King of ye South shall come into his kingdome, and shall returne into his owne land.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Wherefore his sonnes shall be stirred vp, and shall assemble a mightie great armie: and one shall come, and ouerflowe, and passe through: then shall he returne, and be stirred vp at his fortresse.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the King of the South shall be angrie, and shall come foorth, and fight with him, euen with the King of the North: for he shall set foorth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be giuen into his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the multitude shall be proude, and their heart shall be lifted vp: for hee shall cast downe thousands: but he shall not still preuaile.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For the King of the North shall returne, and shall set foorth a greater multitude then afore, and shall come foorth (after certeine yeeres) with a mightie armie, and great riches.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And at the same time there shall many stand vp against the King of the South: also the rebellious children of thy people shall exalt them selues to establish the vision, but they shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the King of the North shall come, and cast vp a mount, and take the strong citie: and the armes of the South shall not resist, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But he that shall come, shall doe vnto him as he list, and none shall stand against him: and he shall stand in the pleasant land, which by his hand shalbe consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Againe he shall set his face to enter with the power of his whole kingdome, and his confederates with him: thus shall he doe, and he shall giue him the daughter of women, to destroy her: but she shall not stande on his side, neither bee for him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>After this shall he turne his face vnto the yles, and shall take many, but a prince shall cause his shame to light vpon him, beside that he shall cause his owne shame to turne vpon himselfe.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For he shall turne his face toward the fortes of his owne land: but he shall be ouerthrowen and fall, and be no more founde.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then shall stand vp in his place in the glorie of the kingdome, one that shall raise taxes: but after fewe dayes he shall be destroyed, neither in wrath, nor in battell.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And in his place shall stand vp a vile person, to whom they shall not giue the honour of the kingdome: but he shall come in peaceably, and obteine the kingdome by flatteries.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the armes shall be ouerthrowen with a flood before him, and shall be broken: and also the prince of the couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And after the league made with him, he shall worke deceitfully: for he shall come vp, and ouercome with a small people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He shall enter into the quiet and plentifull prouince, and he shall doe that which his fathers haue not done, nor his fathers fathers: he shall deuide among them the pray and the spoyle, and the substance, yea, and he shall forecast his deuises against the strong holdes, euen for a time.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Also he shall stirre vp his power and his courage against the King of the South with a great armie, and the King of the South shall be stirred vp to battell with a very great and mightie armie: but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast and practise against him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Yea, they that feede of the portion of his meate, shall destroy him: and his armie shall ouerflowe: and many shall fall, and be slaine.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And both these Kings hearts shall be to do mischiefe, and they shall talke of deceite at one table: but it shall not auaile: for yet the ende shall be at the time appointed.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then shall he returne into his land with great substance: for his heart shall be against the holy couenant: so shall he doe and returne to his owne land.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>At the time appointed he shall returne, and come toward the South: but the last shall not be as the first.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For the shippes of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shalbe sorie and returne, and freat against the holy couenant: so shall he doe, he shall euen returne and haue intelligence with them that forsake the holy couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And armes shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the Sanctuarie of strength, and shall take away the dayly sacrifice, and they shall set vp the abominable desolation.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And such as wickedly breake ye couenant, shall he cause to sinne by flatterie: but the people that do know their God, shall preuaile and prosper.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they that vnderstand among the people, shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by sword, and by flame, by captiuitie and by spoile many dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Nowe when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a litle helpe: but many shall cleaue vnto them fainedly.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And some of the of vnderstanding shall fall to trie them, and to purge, and to make them white, till the time be out: for there is a time appointed.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the King shall doe what him list: he shall exalt himselfe, and magnifie himselfe against all, that is God, and shall speake marueilous things against ye God of gods, and shall prosper, till ye wrath be accomplished: for ye determination is made.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desires of women, nor care for any God: for he shall magnifie himselfe aboue all.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But in his place shall he honour the god Mauzzim, and the god whom his fathers knewe not, shall he honour with golde and with siluer, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Thus shall he do in the holdes of Mauzzim with a strange god whom he shall acknowledge: he shall increase his glory, and shall cause them to rule ouer many and shall deuide ye land for gaine.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And at ye end of time shall the King of the South push at him, and the king of the North shall come against him like a whirlewind with charets, and with horsemen, and with many ships, and he shall enter into ye countreis, and shall ouerflow and passe through.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>He shall enter also into the pleasant land, and many countreis shalbe ouerthrowen: but these shall escape out of his hand, euen Edom and Moab, and the chiefe of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>He shall stretch foorth his hands also vpon the countreis, and ye land of Egypt shall not escape.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>But he shall haue power ouer the treasures of golde and of siluer, and ouer all the precious things of Egypt, and of the Lybians, and of the blacke Mores where he shall passe.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>But the tidings out of the East and the North shall trouble him: therefore he shall goe foorth with great wrath to destroy and roote out many.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace betweene the seas in the glorious and holy mountaine, yet he shall come to his end, and none shall helpe him.
