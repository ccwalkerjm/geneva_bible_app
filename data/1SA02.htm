And the childe Samuel grewe before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Eli was very olde, and heard all that his sonnes did vnto all Israel, and howe they laye with the women that assembled at the doore of the tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And hee saide vnto them, Why doe ye such things? for of all this people I heare euill reportes of you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Do no more, my sonnes, for it is no good report that I heare, which is, that ye make the Lords people to trespasse.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If one man sinne against another, the Iudge shall iudge it: but if a man sinne against the Lord, who will pleade for him? Notwithstanding they obeyed not the voyce of their father, because the Lord would slay them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>(Nowe the childe Samuel profited and grewe, and was in fauour both with the Lord and also with men)  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there came a man of God vnto Eli, and said vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Did not I plainely appeare vnto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaohs house?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my Priest, to offer vpon mine altar, and to burne incense, and to weare an Ephod before me, and I gaue vnto the house of thy father all the offrings made by fire of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Wherefore haue you kicked against my sacrifice and mine offering, which I commanded in my Tabernacle, and honourest thy children aboue mee, to make your selues fatte of the first fruites of all the offerings of Israel my people?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I saide, that thine house and the house of thy father should walke before mee for euer: but nowe the Lord saith, It shall not be so: for them that honour me, I will honour, and they that despise me, shall be despised.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Beholde, the dayes come, that I will cut off thine arme, and the arme of thy fathers house, that there shall not be an olde man in thine house.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And thou shalt see thine enemie in the habitation of the Lord in all thinges wherewith God shall blesse Israel, and there shall not be an olde man in thine house for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, I will not destroy euery one of thine from mine altar, to make thine eyes to faile, and to make thine heart sorowfull: and all ye multitude of thine house shall die when they be men.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And this shalbe a signe vnto thee, that shall come vpon thy two sonnes Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I will stirre me vp a faithfull Priest, that shall do according to mine heart and according to my minde: and I wil build him a sure house, and he shall walke before mine Anointed for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And all that are left in thine house, shall come and bowe downe to him for a piece of siluer and a morsell of bread, and shall say, Appoint me, I pray thee, to one of the priestes offices, that I may eate a morsell of bread. </div><ul class='tnav'>
