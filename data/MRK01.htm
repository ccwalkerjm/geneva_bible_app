Art thou come to destroy vs? I knowe thee what thou art, euen that holy one of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the vncleane spirit tare him, and cried with a loude voyce, and came out of him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they were all amased, so that they demaunded one of another, saying, What thing is this? what newe doctrine is this? for he commandeth euen the foule spirites with authoritie, and they obey him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And immediatly his fame spred abroade throughout all the region bordering on Galile.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And assoone as they were come out of the Synagogue, they entred into the house of Symon and Andrew, with Iames and Iohn.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Symons wiues mother lay sicke of a feuer, and anon they told him of her.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he came and tooke her by the hand, and lifted her vp, and the feuer forsooke her by and by, and shee ministred vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And whe euen was come, at what time the sunne setteth, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with deuils.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the whole citie was gathered together at the doore.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he healed many that were sicke of diuers diseases: and he cast out many deuils, and suffred not the deuils to say that they knewe him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And in the morning very early before day, Iesus arose and went out into a solitarie place, and there praied.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Simon, and they that were with him, followed carefully after him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And when they had found him, they sayde vnto him, All men seeke for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then he said vnto them, Let vs go into the next townes, that I may preach there also: for I came out for that purpose.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And hee preached in their Synagogues, throughout all Galile, and cast the deuils out.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeled downe vnto him, and said to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Iesus had compassion, and put foorth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I wil: be thou cleane.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And assone as he had spoken, immediatly ye leprosie departed from him, and he was made cleane.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And after he had giue him a streight commandement, he sent him away forthwith,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And sayde vnto him, See thou say nothing to any man, but get thee hence, and shewe thy selfe to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing those things, which Moses commanded, for a testimoniall vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But when he was departed, hee began to tel many things, and to publish the matter: so that Iesus could no more openly enter into the citie, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from euery quarter. </div><ul class='tnav'>
