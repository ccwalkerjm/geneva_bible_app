Bring him vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So they brought him vnto him: and assoone as the spirit sawe him, hee tare him, and hee fell downe on the ground walowing and foming.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then he asked his father, How long time is it since he hath bin thus? And he said, Of a childe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And oft times he casteth him into the fire, and into the water to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, helpe vs, and haue compassion vpon vs.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Iesus said vnto him, If thou canst beleeue it, al things are possible to him that beleeueth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And straightway the father of the childe crying with teares, saide, Lord, I beleeue: helpe my vnbeliefe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When Iesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the vncleane spirit, saying vnto him, Thou domme and deafe spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out, and he was as one dead, in so much that many said, He is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Iesus tooke his hande, and lift him vp, and he arose.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when hee was come into the house, his disciples asked him secretly, Why could not we cast him out?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he saide vnto them, This kinde can by no other meanes come foorth, but by prayer and fasting.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And they departed thence, and went together through Galile, and hee would not that any should haue knowen it.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For he taught his disciples, and saide vnto them, The Sonne of man shalbe deliuered into the handes of men, and they shall kill him, but after that he is killed, he shall rise againe the third day.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But they vnderstoode not that saying, and were afraide to aske him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>After, he came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house, he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among you by the way?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they helde their peace: for by the way they reasoned among themselues, who should bee the chiefest.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he sate downe, and called the twelue, and said to them, If any man desire to be first, the same shalbe last of all, and seruant vnto all.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he tooke a litle childe, and set him in the middes of them, and tooke him in his armes, and sayd vnto them,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Whosoeuer shall receiue one of such litle children in my Name, receiueth me: and whosoeuer receiueth mee, receiueth not me, but him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then Iohn answered him, saying, Master, we sawe one casting out deuils by thy Name, which followeth not vs, and we forbade him, because he followeth vs not.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But Iesus sayd, Forbid him not: for there is no man that can doe a miracle by my Name, that can lightly speake euill of me.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For whosoeuer is not against vs, is on our part.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And whosoeuer shall giue you a cup of water to drinke for my Names sake, because ye belong to Christ, verely I say vnto you, he shall not lose his rewarde.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And whosoeuer shall offend one of these litle ones, that beleeue in me, it were better for him rather, that a milstone were hanged about his necke, and that he were cast into the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Wherefore, if thine hand cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life, maimed, then hauing two hands, to goe into hell, into the fire that neuer shalbe quenched,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Where their worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer goeth out.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Likewise, if thy foote cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to go halt into life, then hauing two feete, to be cast into hell, into the fire that neuer shalbe quenched,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Where their worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer goeth out.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And if thine eye cause thee to offende, plucke it out: it is better for thee to goe into the kingdome of God with one eye, then hauing two eyes, to be cast into hell fire,  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Where their worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer goeth out.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>For euery man shalbe salted with fire: and euery sacrifice shalbe salted with salt.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Salt is good: but if the salt be vnsauerie, wherewith shall it be seasoned? haue salt in your selues, and haue peace one with another. </div><ul class='tnav'>
