The order was thus, a Rubie, a Topaze, and a Carbuncle in the first rowe:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And in the seconde rowe, an Emeraude, a Saphir, and a Diamond:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Also in the thirde rowe, a Turkeis, an Achate, and an Hematite:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Likewise in the fourth rowe, a Chrysolite, an Onix, and a Iasper: closed and set in ouches of golde.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, euen twelue after their names, grauen like signets euery one after his name according to the twelue tribes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>After, they made vpon the brest plate cheines at the endes, of wrethen worke and pure golde.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They made also two bosses of golde, and two golde rings, and put the two rings in the two corners of the brest plate.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they put ye two wrethe cheines of gold in the two rings, in the corners of the brest plate.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Also the two other endes of the two wrethen chaines they fastened in the two bosses, and put the on the shoulders of the Ephod vpon the forefront of it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Likewise they made two rings of gold, and put them in the two other corners of the brest plate vpon the edge of it, which was on the inside of the Ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They made also two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the Ephod, beneath on the foreside of it, and ouer against his coupling aboue the broydered garde of the Ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then they fastened the brest plate by his rings vnto the rings of the Ephod, with a lace of blewe silke, that it might bee fast vpon the broydered garde of the Ephod, and that the brest plate should not be loosed from the Ephod, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moreouer, he made the robe of the Ephod of wouen worke, altogether of blewe silke.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the hole of the robe was in the middes of it, as the coller of an habergeon, with an edge about the coller, that it shoulde not rent.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they made vpon the skirts of the robe pomegranates, of blewe silke, and purple, and skarlet, and fine linen twined.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They made also belles of pure gold and put the belles betweene the pomegranates vpon the skirtes of the robe rounde about betweene the pomegranates.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A bel and a pomegranate, a bel and a pomegranate round about the skirts of the robe to minister in, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>After, they made coates of fine linen, of wouen worke for Aaron and for his sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the miter of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the girdle of fine twined linen, and of blew silke, and purple, and skarlet, euen of needle worke, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Finally they made the plate for the holy crowne of fine golde, and wrote vpon it a superscription like to the grauing of a signet, HOLINES TO THE LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they tied vnto it a lace of blewe silke to fasten it on hie vpon the miter, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thus was all the worke of the Tabernacle, euen of the Tabernacle of the Congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to al that the Lord had commanded Moses: so dyd they.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Afterwarde they brought the Tabernacle vnto Moses, the Tabernacle and al his instruments, his taches, his boards, his barres, and his pillars, and his sockets,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the couering of rammes skinnes died red, and the couerings of badgers skinnes, and the couering vaile.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Arke of the Testimony, and the barres thereof, and the Merciseate,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The Table, with all the instruments thereof, and the shewebread,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The pure Candlesticke, the lampes thereof, euen the lampes set in order, and all the instruments thereof, and the oyle for light:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Also the golden Altar and the anoynting oyle, and the sweete incense, and the hanging of the Tabernacle doore,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The brasen Altar with his grate of brasse, his barres and all his instruments, the Lauer and his foote.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>The curtaines of the court with his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging to the court gate, and his cordes, and his pinnes, and all the instruments of the seruice of the Tabernacle, called the Tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Finally, the ministring garmentes to serue in the Sanctuarie, and the holy garmentes for Aaron the Priest, and his sonnes garmentes to minister in the Priestes office.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>According to euery poynt that the Lord had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the worke.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Moses beheld al the worke, and behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded: so had they done: and Moses blessed them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
