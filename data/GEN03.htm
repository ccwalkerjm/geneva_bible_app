Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eate?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the man saide, The woman which thou gauest to be with me, she gaue me of the tree, and I did eate.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord God saide to the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eate.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the Lord God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed aboue all cattell, and aboue euery beast of the fielde: vpon thy belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt thou eate all the dayes of thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will also put enimitie betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy seede and her seede. He shall breake thine head, and thou shalt bruise his heele.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Vnto the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy sorowes, and thy conceptions. In sorowe shalt thou bring foorth children, and thy desire shalbe subiect to thine husband, and he shall rule ouer thee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Also to Adam he said, Because thou hast obeyed the voyce of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, (whereof I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eate of it) cursed is the earth for thy sake: in sorowe shalt thou eate of it all the dayes of thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thornes also, and thistles shall it bring foorth to thee, and thou shalt eate the herbe of the fielde.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate bread, till thou returne to the earth: for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou returne.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>(And the man called his wiues name Heuah, because she was the mother of all liuing)  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Vnto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coates of skinnes, and clothed them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord God said, Beholde, the man is become as one of vs, to knowe good and euill. And nowe lest he put foorth his hand, and take also of ye tree of life and eate and liue for euer,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord God sent him foorth from the garden of Eden, to till ye earth, whence he was taken.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus he cast out man, and at the East side of the garden of Eden he set the Cherubims, and the blade of a sworde shaken, to keepe the way of the tree of life. </div><ul class='tnav'>
