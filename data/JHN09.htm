<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And as Iesus passed by, he sawe a man which was blinde from his birth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sinne, this man, or his parents, that he was borne blinde?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Iesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the workes of God should be shewed on him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I must worke the workes of him that sent me, while it is day: the night commeth when no man can worke.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Assoone as he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spettle, and anointed the eyes of the blinde with the clay,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And sayd vnto him, Go wash in the poole of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came againe seeing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Nowe the neighbours and they that had seene him before, when he was blinde, sayd, Is not this he that sate and begged?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Some said, This is he: and other sayd, He is like him: but he himselfe sayd, I am he.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore they sayd vnto him, Howe were thine eyes opened?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He answered, and sayd, The man that is called Iesus, made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and sayde vnto me, Goe to the poole of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and receiued sight.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then they sayd vnto him, Where is he? He sayd, I can not tell.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They brought to the Pharises him that was once blinde.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it was the Sabbath day, when Iesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then againe the Pharises also asked him, how he had receiued sight. And hee sayd vnto them, He layd clay vpon mine eyes, and I washed, and doe see.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then said some of the Pharises, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath day. Others sayd, Howe can a man that is a sinner, doe such miracles? and there was a dissension among them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then spake they vnto the blinde againe, What sayest thou of him, because he hath opened thine eyes? And he sayd, He is a Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the Iewes did not beleeue him (that he had bene blinde, and receiued his sight) vntill they had called the parents of him that had receiued sight.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they asked them, saying, Is this your sonne, whom ye say was borne blinde? How doeth he nowe see then?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>His parents answered them, and sayd, We know that this is our sonne, and that he was borne blinde:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But by what meanes hee nowe seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, can we not tell: he is olde ynough: aske him: hee shall answere for himselfe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>These wordes spake his parents, because they feared the Iewes: for the Iewes had ordeined already, that if any man did confesse that he was Christ, he should be excommunicate out of the Synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore sayde his parents, Hee is olde ynough: aske him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then againe called they the man that had bene blinde, and sayd vnto him, Giue glory vnto God: we know that this man is a sinner.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then he answered, and sayd, Whether hee be a sinner or no, I can not tell: one thing I know, that I was blinde, and nowe I see.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then sayd they to him againe, What did he to thee? howe opened he thine eyes?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Hee answered them, I haue tolde you already, and yee haue not heard it: wherefore would yee heare it againe? will yee also be his disciples?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then reuiled they him, and sayd, Be thou his disciple: we be Moses disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>We know that God spake with Moses: but this man we know not from whence he is.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The man answered, and sayde vnto them, Doutlesse, this is a marueilous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him heareth he.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Since the world began, was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blinde.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>If this man were not of God, hee could haue done nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They answered, and sayd vnto him, Thou art altogether borne in sinnes, and doest thou teach vs? so they cast him out.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Iesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he sayd vnto him, Doest thou beleeue in the Sonne of God?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He answered, and sayd, Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeue in him?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Iesus sayd vnto him, Both thou hast seene him, and he it is that talketh with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then he sayd, Lord, I beleeue, and worshipped him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Iesus sayd, I am come vnto iudgement into this world, that they which see not, might see: and that they which see, might be made blinde.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And some of the Pharises which were with him, heard these things, and sayd vnto him, Are we blinde also?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Iesus sayd vnto them, If ye were blinde, ye should not haue sinne: but nowe ye say, We see: therefore your sinne remaineth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
