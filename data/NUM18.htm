iniquitie of the Sanctuarie: both thou and thy sonnes with thee shall beare the iniquitie of your Priestes office.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And bring also with thee thy brethren of the tribe of Leui of ye familie of thy father, which shalbe ioyned with thee, and minister vnto thee: but thou, and thy sonnes with thee shall minister before the Tabernacle of the Testimonie:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they shall keepe thy charge, euen the charge of all the Tabernacle: but they shall not come neere the instruments of the Sanctuary, nor to the altar, lest they die, both they and you:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they shalbe ioyned with thee, and keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation for all the seruice of the Tabernacle: and no stranger shall come neere vnto you:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Therefore shall ye keepe the charge of the Sanctuarie, and the charge of the altar: so there shall fall no more wrath vpon the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For lo, I haue taken your brethren the Leuites from among the children of Israel, which as a gift of yours, are giuen vnto the Lord, to do the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But thou, and thy sonnes with thee shall keepe your Priestes office for all things of the altar, and within the vaile: therefore shall ye serue: for I haue made your Priestes office an office of seruice: therefore the stranger that cometh neere, shalbe slayne.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Againe the Lord spake vnto Aaron, Behold, I haue giuen thee the keeping of mine offrings, of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel: vnto thee I haue giuen them for the anoyntings sake, and to thy sonnes, for a perpetuall ordinance.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This shalbe thine of the most holy things, reserued from the fire: all their offering of all their meate offring, and of all their sinne offring, and of all their trespasse offring, which they bring vnto me, that shalbe most holy vnto thee, and to thy sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In the most holy place shalt thou eate it: euery male shall eate of it: it is holy vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This also shalbe thine: the heaue offering of their gift, with all the shake offerings of the children of Israel: I haue giuen them vnto thee and to thy sonnes and to thy daughters with thee, to be a duetie for euer al the cleane in thine house shall eate of it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All the fat of the oyle, and all the fat of the wine, and of the wheate, which they shall offer vnto the Lord for their first fruites, I haue giuen them vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the first ripe of al that is in their land, which they shall bring vnto Lord, shalbe thine: all the cleane in thine house shall eate of it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Euery thing separate from the common vse in Israel, shalbe thine.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All that first openeth the matrice of any flesh, which they shall offer vnto the Lord, of man or beast, shalbe thine: but the first borne of man shalt thou redeeme, and the first borne of the vncleane beast shalt thou redeeme.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And those that are to bee redeemed, shalt thou redeeme from the age of a moneth, according to thy estimation, for the money of fiue shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuarie, which is twentie gerahs.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the first borne of a kow, or the first borne of a sheepe, or the first borne of a goate shalt thou not redeeme: for they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood at the altar, and thou shalt burne their fat: it is a sacrifice made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the flesh of them shalbe thine, as the shake breast, and as the right shoulder shalbe thine.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All the heaue offrings of the holy things which the children of Israel shall offer vnto the Lord, haue I giuen thee, and thy sonnes, and thy daughters with thee, to be a duetie for euer: it is a perpetual couenant of salt before the Lord, to thee, and to thy seede with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord sayde vnto Aaron, Thou shalt haue none inheritance in their lande, neyther shalt thou haue any parte among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For beholde, I haue giuen the children of Leui all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their seruice which they serue in the Tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Neyther shall the children of Israel any more come neere the Tabernacle of the Congregation, lest they susteine sinne, and die.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the Leuites shall do the seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and they shall beare their sinne: it is a law for euer in your generations, that among the children of Israel they possesse none inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For the tythes of the children of Israel, which they shall offer as an offring vnto the Lord, I haue giuen the Leuites for an inheritance: therfore I haue said vnto them, Among the children of Israel ye shall possesse none inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Speake also vnto the Leuites and say vnto them, When ye shall take of the children of Israel the tithes, which I haue giuen you of them for your inheritance, then shall ye take an heaue offring of that same for the Lord, euen the tenth part of the tithe.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And your heaue offering shalbe reckened vnto you, as the corne of the barne, or as the abundance of the wine presse.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So ye shall also offer an heaue offring vnto the Lord of all your tithes, which ye shall receiue of the children of Israel, and ye shall giue thereof the Lords heaue offring to Aaron the Priest.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Ye shall offer of all your gifts al the Lords heaue offrings: of all the fat of the same shall ye offer the holy things thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore thou shalt say vnto them, When ye haue offred the fat thereof, then it shalbe couted vnto the Leuites, as the encrease of the corne floore, or as the encrease of the wine presse.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And ye shall eate it in al places, ye, and your housholdes: for it is your wages for your seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And ye shall beare no sinne by the reason of it, when ye haue offred the fatte of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die. </div><ul class='tnav'>
