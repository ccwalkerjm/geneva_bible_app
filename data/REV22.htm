Blessed is hee that keepeth the woordes of the prophecie of this booke.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I am Iohn, which sawe and heard these thinges: and when I had heard and seene, I fell downe to worship before the feete of the Angell which shewed me these things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But he sayde vnto me, See thou doe it not: for I am thy fellowe seruaunt, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keepe the woordes of this booke: worship God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said vnto me, Seale not the wordes of the prophecie of this booke: for the time is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He that is vniust, let him be vniust stil and he which is filthie, let him be filthie still: and hee that is righteous, let him be righteous stil: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And beholde, I come shortly, and my reward is with mee, to giue euery man according as his worke shall be.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Blessed are they, that doe his commandements, that their right may be in the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the Citie.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For without shall be dogs and inchanters, and whoremongers, and murtherers, and idolaters, and whosoeuer loueth or maketh lies.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I Iesus haue sent mine Angell, to testifie vnto you these things in the Churches: I am the root and the generation of Dauid, and the bright morning starre.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth, say, Come: and let him that is a thirst, come: and let whosoeuer will, take of the water of life freely.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I protest vnto euery man that heareth the words of the prophecie of this booke, If any man shall adde vnto these things, God shall adde vnto him the plagues, that are written in this booke:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if any man shall diminish of the wordes of the booke of this prophecie, God shall take away his part out of the Booke of life, and out of the holie citie, and from those things which are written in this booke.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He which testifieth these things, saith, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Euen so, come Lord Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all, AMEN. </div><ul class='tnav'>
