I would go through them, I would burne them together.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Or will he feele my strength, that he may make peace with me, and be at one with me?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Hereafter, Iaakob shall take roote: Israel shall florish and growe, and the world shall be filled with fruite.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Hath hee smitten him as hee smote those that smote him? or is hee slaine according to the slaughter of them that were slaine by him?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In measure in the branches thereof wilt thou contende with it, when he bloweth with his rough winde in the day of the East winde.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>By this therefore shall the iniquitie of Iaakob be purged, and this is all the fruit, the taking away of his sinne: whe he shall make all the stones of the altars, as chalke stones broken in pieces, that the groues and images may not stand vp.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yet the defenced citie shalbe desolate, and the habitation shalbe forsaken, and left like a wildernes.
