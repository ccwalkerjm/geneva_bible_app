And the Lord answered Dauid, Goe vp: for I will doubtlesse deliuer the Philistims into thine handes.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Dauid came to Baal-perazim, and smote them there, and sayde, The Lord hath deuided mine enemies asunder before mee, as waters be deuided asunder: therefore he called the name of that place, Baal-perazim.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And there they left their images, and Dauid and his men burnt them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Againe the Philistims came vp, and spred themselues in the valley of Rephaim.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when Dauid asked counsell of the Lord, hee answered, Thou shalt not goe vp, but turne about behinde them, and come vpon them ouer against the mulberie trees.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when thou hearest the noyse of one going in the toppes of the mulberie trees, then remoue: for then shall the Lord goe out before thee, to smite the hoste of the Philistims.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Dauid did so as the Lord had commanded him, and smote the Philistims from Geba, vntil thou come to Gazer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
