that as I haue shewed you mercie, ye will also shewe mercie vnto my fathers house, and giue me a true token,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And that yee will saue aliue my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they haue: and that yee will deliuer our soules from death.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the men answered her, Our life for you to die, if ye vtter not this our businesse: and when the Lord hath giuen vs the lande, we will deale mercifully and truely with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then she let them downe by a corde thorowe the windowe: for her house was vpon the towne wall, and she dwelt vpon the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she said vnto them, Goe you into the mountaine, least the pursuers meete with you, and hide your selues there three dayes, vntill the pursuers be returned: then afterwarde may yee goe your way.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the men said vnto her, We will be blamelesse of this thine othe, which thou hast made vs sweare.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this cord of red threde in the window, whereby thou lettest vs downe, and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy fathers houshold home to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And whosoeuer then doeth goe out at the doores of thine house into the streete, his blood shalbe vpon his head, and we will be giltlesse: but whosoeuer shall be with thee in the house, his blood shalbe on our head, if any hande touch him:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And if thou vtter this our matter, we will be quite of thine othe, which thou hast made vs sweare.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And she answered, According vnto your wordes, so be it: then she sent them away, and they departed, and she bound the red cord in ye window.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they departed, and came into the mountaine, and there abode three dayes, vntil the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but founde them not.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountaine, and passed ouer, and came to Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and tolde him all things that came vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Also they saide vnto Ioshua, Surely the Lord hath deliuered into our handes all the lande: for euen all the inhabitants of the countrey faint because of vs. </div><ul class='tnav'>
