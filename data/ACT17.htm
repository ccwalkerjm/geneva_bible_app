Others sayde, He seemeth to be a setter forth of straunge gods (because hee preached vnto them Iesus, and the resurrection.)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they tooke him, and brought him into Mars streete, saying, May we not know, what this newe doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For thou bringest certaine strange thinges vnto our eares: we woulde knowe therefore, what these things meane.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For all the Athenians, and strangers which dwelt there, gaue them selues to nothing els, but either to tell, or to heare some newes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Paul stoode in the mids of Mars streete, and sayde, Yee men of Athens, I perceiue that in all things yee are too superstitious.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For as I passed by, and behelde your deuotions, I founde an altar wherein was written, VNTO THE VNKNOWEN GOD. Whom ye then ignorantly worship, him shewe I vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>God that made the world, and all things that are therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaue and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Neither is worshipped with mens handes, as though he needed any thing, seeing hee giueth to all life and breath and all things,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And hath made of one blood all mankinde, to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath assigned the seasons which were ordeined before, and the boundes of their habitation,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>That they shoulde seeke the Lord, if so be they might haue groped after him, and founde him though doubtlesse he be not farre from euery one of vs.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our being, as also certaine of your owne Poets haue sayd, for we are also his generation.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Forasmuch then, as we are the generation of God, we ought not to thinke that ye Godhead is like vnto gold, or siluer, or stone grauen by arte and the inuention of man.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the time of this ignorance God regarded not: but nowe hee admonisheth all men euery where to repent,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Because hee hath appoynted a day in the which he wil iudge the world in righteousnes, by that man whome hee hath appoynted, whereof he hath giuen an assurance to all men, in that hee hath raised him from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Now when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked, and other sayde, We will heare thee againe of this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And so Paul departed from among them.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Howbeit certaine men claue vnto Paul, and beleeued: among whome was also Denys Areopagita, and a woman named Damaris, and other with them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
