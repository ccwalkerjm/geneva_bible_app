Euen so sayth the Spirit: for they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I looked, and behold, a white cloude, and vpon the cloude one sitting like vnto the Sonne of man, hauing on his head a golden crowne, and in his hand a sharpe sickle.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And another Angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loude voyce to him that sate on the cloude, Thrust in thy sickle and reape: for the time is come to reape: for the haruest of the earth is ripe.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he that sate on the cloude, thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then an other Angel came out of the Temple, which is in heauen, hauing also a sharpe sickle.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And another Angel came out from the altar, which had power ouer fire, and cryed with a loude crie to him that had the sharpe sickle, and sayd, Thrust in thy sharpe sickle, and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth: for her grapes are ripe.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Angel thrust in his sharpe sickle on the earth, and cut downe the vines of the vineyard of the earth, and cast them into that great wine presse of the wrath of God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the wine presse was troden without the citie, and blood came out of the wine presse, vnto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and sixe hundreth furlongs. </div><ul class='tnav'>
