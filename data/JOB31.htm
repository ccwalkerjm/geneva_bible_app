and what inheritance of the Almightie from on hie?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Is not destruction to the wicked and strange punishment to the workers of iniquitie?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Doeth not he beholde my wayes and tell all my steps?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If I haue walked in vanitie, or if my foote hath made haste to deceite,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let God weigh me in the iust balance, and he shall know mine vprightnes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If my steppe hath turned out of the way, or mine heart hath walked after mine eye, or if any blot hath cleaued to mine handes,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let me sowe, and let another eate: yea, let my plantes be rooted out.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If mine heart hath bene deceiued by a woman, or if I haue layde wayte at the doore of my neighbour,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let my wife grinde vnto another man, and let other men bow downe vpon her:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For this is a wickednes, and iniquitie to bee condemned:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yea, this is a fire that shall deuoure to destruction, and which shall roote out al mine increase,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If I did contemne the iudgement of my seruant, and of my mayde, when they did contend with me,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>What then shall I do when God standeth vp? and when he shall visit me, what shall I answere?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that hath made me in the wombe, hath he not made him? hath not he alone facioned vs in the wombe?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If I restrained the poore of their desire, or haue caused the eyes of the widow to faile,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Or haue eaten my morsels alone, and the fatherles hath not eaten thereof,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>(For from my youth hee hath growen vp with me as with a father, and from my mothers wombe I haue bene a guide vnto her)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If I haue seene any perish for want of clothing, or any poore without couering,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>If his loynes haue not blessed me, because he was warmed with the fleece of my sheepe,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If I haue lift vp mine hande against the fatherlesse, when I saw that I might helpe him in the gate,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let mine arme fal from my shoulder, and mine arme be broken from the bone.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For Gods punishment was fearefull vnto me, and I could not be deliuered from his highnes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If I made gold mine hope, or haue sayd to the wedge of golde, Thou art my confidence,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If I reioyced because my substance was great, or because mine hand had gotten much,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If I did behold the sunne, when it shined, or the moone, walking in her brightnes,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If mine heart did flatter me in secrete, or if my mouth did kisse mine hand,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>(This also had bene an iniquitie to be condemned: for I had denied the God aboue)  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If I reioyced at his destruction that hated me, or was mooued to ioye when euill came vpon him,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Neither haue I suffred my mouth to sinne, by wishing a curse vnto his soule.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Did not the men of my Tabernacle say, Who shall giue vs of his flesh? we can not bee satisfied.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The stranger did not lodge in the streete, but I opened my doores vnto him, that went by the way.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>If I haue hid my sinne, as Adam, concealing mine iniquitie in my bosome,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Though I could haue made afraid a great multitude, yet the most contemptible of the families did feare me: so I kept silence, and went not out of the doore.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Oh that I had some to heare me! beholde my signe that the Almightie will witnesse for me: though mine aduersary should write a booke against me,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Woulde not I take it vpon my shoulder, and binde it as a crowne vnto me?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>I will tell him the nomber of my goings, and goe vnto him as to a prince.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>If my lande cry against me, or the furrowes thereof complayne together,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>If I haue eaten the fruites thereof without siluer: or if I haue grieued the soules of the masters thereof,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Let thistles growe in steade of wheate, and cockle in the stead of Barley.
