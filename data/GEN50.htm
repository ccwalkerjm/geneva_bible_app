And nowe, we pray thee, forgiue the trespasse of the seruants of thy fathers God. And Ioseph wept, when they spake vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Also his brethren came vnto him, and fell downe before his face, and sayde, Beholde, we be thy seruants.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>To whome Ioseph sayde, Feare not: for am not I vnder God?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When ye thought euill against mee, God disposed it to good, that he might bring to passe, as it is this day, and saue much people aliue.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Feare not nowe therefore, I will nourish you, and your children: and hee comforted them, and spake kindly vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Ioseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his fathers house: and Ioseph liued an hundreth and tenne yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Ioseph saw Ephraims children, euen vnto the third generation: also the sonnes of Machir the sonne of Manasseh were brought vp on Iosephs knees.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Ioseph sayd vnto his brethren, I am ready to dye, and God will surely visite you, and bring you out of this land, vnto ye land which hee sware vnto Abraham, vnto Izhak, and vnto Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Ioseph tooke an othe of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visite you, and ye shall cary my bones hence.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So Ioseph died, when he was an hundreth and ten yere olde: and they enbaumed him and put him in a chest in Egypt. </div><ul class='tnav'>
