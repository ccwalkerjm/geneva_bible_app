<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 25</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Amaziah was fiue and twentie yere old when he began to reigne, and he reigned nine and twentie yeere in Ierusalem: and his mothers name was Iehoaddan, of Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he did vprightly in the eyes of the Lord, but not with a perfite heart.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And when the kingdome was established vnto him, he slewe his seruants, that had slaine the King his father.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But he slewe not their children, but did as it is written in the Lawe, and in the booke of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not dye for the children, neyther shall the children die for the fathers, but euery man shall dye for his owne sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Amaziah assembled Iudah, and made them captaines ouer thousandes, and captaines ouer hundreths, according to the houses of their fathers, thorowout all Iudah and Beniamin: and he nombred them from twentie yeere olde and aboue, and founde among them three hundreth thousand chosen men, to goe foorth to the warre, and to handle speare and shield.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He hyred also an hundreth thousand valiant men out of Israel for an hundreth talents of siluer.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But a man of God came to him, saying, O King, let not the armie of Israel goe with thee: for the Lord is not with Israel, neither with all the house of Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If not, goe thou on, doe it, make thy selfe strong to the battel, but God shall make thee fall before the enemie: for God hath power to helpe, and to cast downe.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Amaziah sayde to the man of God, What shall we doe then for the hundreth talents, which I haue giuen to the hoste of Israel? Then the man of God answered, The Lord is able to giue thee more then this.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Amaziah separated them, to wit, the armie that was come to him out of Ephraim, to returne to their place: wherefore their wrath was kindled greatly against Iudah, and they returned to their places with great anger.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Amaziah was encouraged, and led forth his people, and went to the salt valley, and smote of the children of Seir, ten thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And other ten thousand did the children of Iudah take aliue, and caryed them to the top of a rocke, and cast them downe from the top of the rocke, and they all burst to pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the men of the armie, which Amaziah sent away, that they should not goe with his people to battell, fell vpon the cities of Iudah from Samaria vnto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and tooke much spoyle.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them vp to be his gods, and worshipped them, and burned incense vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Wherefore the Lord was wroth with Amaziah, and sent vnto him a Prophet, which sayd vnto him, Why hast thou sought the gods of the people, which were not able to deliuer their owne people out of thine hand?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And as he talked with him, he said vnto him, Haue they made thee the Kings counseler? cease thou: why should they smite thee? And the Prophet ceased, but said, I knowe that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not obeyed my counsell.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Amaziah King of Iudah tooke counsell, and sent to Ioash the sonne of Iehoahaz, the sonne of Iehu King of Israel, saying, Come, let vs see one another in the face.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Ioash King of Israel sent to Amaziah King of Iudah, saying, The thistle that is in Lebanon, sent to the cedar that is in Lebanon, saying, Giue thy daughter to my sonne to wife: and the wilde beast that was in Lebanon went and trode downe the thistle.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou thinkest: lo, thou hast smitten Edom, and thine heart lifteth thee vp to bragge: abide now at home: why doest thou prouoke to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, and Iudah with thee?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But Amaziah would not heare: for it was of God, that he might deliuer them into his had, because they had sought the gods of Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Ioash the King of Israel went vp: and he, and Amaziah King of Iudah saw one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which is in Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Iudah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled euery man to his tents.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But Ioash the King of Israel tooke Amaziah King of Iudah, the sonne of Ioash, the sonne of Iehoahaz in Bethshemesh, and brought him to Ierusalem, and brake downe the wall of Ierusalem, from the gate of Ephraim vnto the corner gate, foure hundreth cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he tooke all the gold and the siluer, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed Edom, and in the treasures of the Kings house, and the children that were in hostage, and returned to Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Amaziah the sonne of Ioash King of Iudah liued after the death of Ioash sonne of Iehoahaz King of Israel, fifteene yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Concerning the rest of the actes of Amaziah first and last, are they not written in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Nowe after the time that Amaziah did turne away from ye Lord, they wrought treason against him in Ierusalem: and when he was fled to Lachish, they sent to Lachish after him, and slewe him there.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they brought him vpon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the citie of Iudah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
