Is thine eye euil, because I am good?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the last shalbe first, and the first last: for many are called, but fewe chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Iesus went vp to Hierusalem, and tooke the twelue disciples apart in the way, and said vnto them,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Beholde, wee goe vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall bee deliuered vnto the chiefe priestes, and vnto the Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And shall deliuer him to the Gentiles, to mocke, and to scourge, and to crucifie him, but the third day he shall rise againe.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then came to him the mother of Zebedeus children with her sonnes, worshipping him, and desiring a certaine thing of him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he said vnto her, What wouldest thou? She said to him, Graunt that these my two sonnes may sit, the one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Iesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye aske. Are ye able to drinke of the cup that I shall drinke of, and to be baptized with the baptisme that I shalbe baptized with? They said to him, We are able.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said vnto them, Ye shall drinke in deede of my cup, and shall be baptized with the baptisme, that I am baptized with, but to sit at my right hande, and at my left hand, is not mine to giue: but it shalbe giuen to them for whome it is prepared of my Father.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when the other ten heard this, they disdained at the two brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore Iesus called them vnto him, and saide, We knowe that the lordes of the Gentiles haue domination ouer them, and they that are great, exercise authoritie ouer them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, let him be your seruant.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Euen as the Sonne of man came not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the ransome of many.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And as they departed from Iericho, a great multitude followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And beholde, two blinde men, sitting by the way side, when they heard that Iesus passed by, cryed, saying, O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the multitude rebuked them, because they should holde their peace: but they cried the more, saying, O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then Iesus stoode still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do to you?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They saide to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Iesus mooued with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediatly their eyes receiued sight, and they followed him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
