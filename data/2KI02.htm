<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And when the Lord would take vp Eliiah into heauen by a whirle winde, Eliiah went with Elisha from Gilgal.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then Eliiah saide to Elisha, Tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel. But Elisha said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came downe to Beth-el.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the children of the Prophets that were at Beth-el, came out to Elisha, and said vnto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take thy master from thine head this day? And he said, Yea, I knowe it: holde ye your peace.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Againe Eliiah saide vnto him, Elisha, tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lord hath sent me to Iericho: But he said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came to Iericho.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the children of the Prophets that were at Iericho, came to Elisha, and saide vnto him, Knowest thou, that the Lord will take thy master from thine head this day? And he sayde, Yea, I knowe it: holde ye your peace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moreouer Eliiah saide vnto him, Tarie, I pray thee, here: for the Lord hath sent me to Iorden. But he saide, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they went both together.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And fiftie men of the sonnes of the Prophets went and stoode on the other side a farre off, and they two stoode by Iorden.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Eliiah tooke his cloke, and wrapt it together, and smote the waters, and they were deuided hither and thither, and they twaine went ouer on the dry lande.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Nowe when they were passed ouer, Eliiah saide vnto Elisha, Aske what I shall doe for thee before I be taken from thee. And Elisha saide, I pray thee, let thy Spirit be double vpon me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he saide, Thou hast asked an hard thing: yet if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt haue it so: and if not, it shall not be.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And as they went walking and talking, beholde, there appeared a charet of fire, and horses of fire, and did separate them twaine. So Eliiah went vp by a whirle winde into heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Elisha saw it, and he cryed, My father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof: and he sawe him no more: and he tooke his owne clothes, and rent them in two pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He tooke vp also the cloke of Eliiah that fell from him, and returned, and stoode by the banke of Iorden.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>After, he tooke the cloke of Eliiah, that fell from him, and smote the waters, and sayde, Where is the Lord God of Eliiah? And so he also, after he had striken the waters, so that they were deuided this way and that way, went ouer, euen Elisha.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when the children of the Prophets, which were at Iericho, saw him on the other side, they sayde, The Spirite of Eliiah doeth rest on Elisha: and they came to meete him, and fell to the grounde before him,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And said vnto him, Beholde nowe, there be with thy seruants fiftie strong men: let them go, we pray thee, and seeke thy master, if so be the Spirite of the Lord hath taken him vp, and cast him vpon some mountaine, or into some valley. But he said, Ye shall not sende.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yet they were instant vpon him, til he was ashamed: wherefore he saide, Sende. So they sent fiftie men, which sought three dayes, but founde him not.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore they returned to him, (for he taryed at Iericho) and he said vnto them, Did not I say vnto you, Goe not?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the men of the citie saide vnto Elisha, Beholde, we pray thee: the situation of this citie is pleasant, as thou, my lorde, seest, but the water is naught, and the ground baren.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then he saide, Bring me a newe cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he went vnto the spring of the waters, and cast there the salt, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I haue healed this water: death shall no more come thereof, neither barennesse to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the waters were healed vntill this day, according to the worde of Elisha which hee had spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he went vp from thence vnto Beth-el. And as he was going vp the way, litle children came out of the citie, and mocked him, and saide vnto him, Come vp, thou balde head, come vp, thou balde head.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he turned backe, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two beares came out of the forest, and tare in pieces two and fourtie children of them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria. </div><ul class='tnav'>
