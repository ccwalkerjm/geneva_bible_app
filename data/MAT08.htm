Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea: and so there was a great calme.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the men marueiled, saying, What man is this, that both the windes and the sea obey him!  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when he was come to the other side into ye countrey of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with deuils, which came out of the graues very fierce, so that no man might goe by that way.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And beholde, they cryed out, saying, Iesus the sonne of God, what haue we to do with thee?

So they went out and departed into the heard of swine: and beholde, the whole heard of swine ranne headlong into the sea, and died in the water.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then the heardmen fled: and when they were come into the citie, they tolde all things, and what was become of them that were possessed with the deuils.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And beholde, all ye citie came out to meete Iesus: and when they sawe him, they besought him to depart out of their coastes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
