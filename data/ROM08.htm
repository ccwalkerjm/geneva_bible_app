<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now then there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, which walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For the Lawe of the Spirite of life, which is in Christ Iesus, hath freed mee from the lawe of sinne and of death.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For (that that was impossible to ye Lawe, in as much as it was weake, because of ye flesh) God sending his owne Sonne, in ye similitude of sinful flesh, and for sinne, condened sinne in the flesh,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>That that righteousnes of the Law might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after ye flesh, but after the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For they that are after the flesh, sauour the things of the flesh: but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the wisedome of the flesh is death: but the wisedome of the Spirit is life and peace,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Because the wisedome of the flesh is enimitie against God: for it is not subiect to the Lawe of God, neither in deede can be.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So then they that are in the flesh, can not please God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Now ye are not in the flesh, but in ye Spirit, because ye spirit of God dwelleth in you: but if any man hath not ye Spirit of Christ, ye same is not his.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And if Christ bee in you, the body is dead, because of sinne: but the Spirite is life for righteousnesse sake.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But if the Spirit of him that raised vp Iesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raised vp Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortall bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore brethren, wee are detters not to the flesh, to liue after the flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For if ye liue after the flesh, ye shall die: but if yee mortifie the deedes of the body by the Spirit, ye shall liue.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For as many as are ledde by the Spirit of God, they are the sonnes of God.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For ye haue not receiued the Spirit of bodage, to feare againe: but ye haue receiued the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The same Spirit beareth witnesse with our spirit, that we are the children of God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If we be children, we are also heires, euen the heires of God, and heires annexed with Christ: if so be that we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I count that the afflictions of this present time are not worthy of the glory, which shalbe shewed vnto vs.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the feruent desire of the creature waiteth when the sonnes of God shalbe reueiled,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Because the creature is subiect to vanitie, not of it owne will, but by reason of him, which hath subdued it vnder hope,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Because the creature also shall be deliuered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For we knowe that euery creature groneth with vs also, and trauaileth in paine together vnto this present.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And not onely the creature, but we also which haue the first fruites of the Spirit, euen we doe sigh in our selues, waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption of our body.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For we are saued by hope: but hope that is seene, is not hope: for how can a man hope for that which he seeth?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But if we hope for that we see not, we doe with patience abide for it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we knowe not what to pray as wee ought: but the Spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sighs, which cannot be expressed.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But he that searcheth the heartes, knoweth what is the meaning of the Spirit: for he maketh request for ye Saints, according to the wil of God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Also we knowe that all thinges worke together for the best vnto them that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpose.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For those which hee knewe before, he also predestinate to bee made like to the image of his Sonne, that hee might be the first borne among many brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Moreouer whom he predestinate, them also he called, and whom he called, them also he iustified, and whom he iustified, them he also glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>What shall we then say to these thinges? If God be on our side, who can be against vs?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Who spared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death, how shall he not with him giue vs all things also?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods chosen? it is God that iustifieth,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Who shall condemne? it is Christ which is dead, yea, or rather, which is risen againe, who is also at the right hand of God, and maketh request also for vs.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? shall tribulation or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakednesse, or perill, or sworde?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>As it is written, For thy sake are we killed all day long: we are counted as sheepe for the slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, in all these thinges we are more then coquerours through him that loued vs.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For I am perswaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shalbe able to separate vs from the loue of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
