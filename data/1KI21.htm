Then they caried him away out of the citie, and stoned him with stones, that he dyed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then they sent to Iezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned and is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when Iezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead, Iezebel sayd to Ahab, Vp, and take possession of the vineyarde of Naboth the Izreelite, which he refused to giue thee for money: for Naboth is not aliue, but is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he rose to go downe to the vineyard of Naboth the Izreelite, to take possession of it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came vnto Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Arise, goe downe to meete Ahab King of Israel, which is in Samaria. loe, he is in the vineyarde of Naboth, whither he is gone downe to take possession of it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore shalt thou say vnto him, Thus sayth the Lord, Hast thou killed, and also gotten possession? And thou shalt speake vnto him, saying, Thus sayth the Lord, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs licke euen thy blood also.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ahab sayd to Eliiah, Hast thou found mee, O mine enemie? And he answered, I haue found thee: for thou hast solde thy selfe to worke wickednes in the sight of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Beholde, I will bring euill vpon thee, and wil take away thy posteritie, and wil cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, as well him that is shut vp, as him that is left in Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I wil make thine house like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah, for the prouocation wherewith thou hast prouoked, and made Israel to sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And also of Iezebel spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eate Iezebel, by the wall of Izreel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The dogs shall eate him of Ahabs stocke, that dyeth in the citie: and him that dyeth in the fieldes, shall the foules of the ayre eate.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>(But there was none like Ahab, who did fell him selfe, to worke wickednesse in the sight of the Lord: whom Iezebel his wife prouoked.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For he did exceeding abominably in following idoles, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.)  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Nowe when Ahab heard those wordes, he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth vpon him and fasted, and lay in sackecloth and went softely.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the worde of the Lord came to Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Seest thou how Ahab is humbled before me? because he submitteth himselfe before me, I will not bring that euill in his dayes, but in his sonnes dayes wil I bring euill vpon his house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
