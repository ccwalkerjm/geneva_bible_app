 <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But we beleeue, through the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ to be saued, euen as they doe.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then all the multitude kept silence, and heard Barnabas and Paul, which told what signes and wonders God had done among the Gentiles by them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when they helde their peace, Iames answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Simeon hath declared, howe God first did visite the Gentiles, to take of them a people vnto his Name.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And to this agree the woordes of the Prophets, as it is written,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>After this I will returne, and will builde againe the tabernacle of Dauid, which is fallen downe, and the ruines thereof will I build againe, and I will set it vp,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>That the residue of men might seeke after the Lord, and all the Gentiles vpon whom my Name is called, saith the Lord which doeth all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>From the beginning of the worlde, God knoweth all his workes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them of the Gentiles that are turned to God,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But that we send vnto them, that they abstaine themselues from filthinesse of idoles, and fornication, and that that is strangled, and from blood.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For Moses of olde time hath in euery citie them that preache him, seeing he is read in the Synagogues euery Sabbath day.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then it seemed good to the Apostles and Elders with the whole Church, to sende chosen men of their owne companie to Antiochia with Paul and Barnabas: to wit, Iudas whose surname was Barsabas and Silas, which were chiefe men among the brethren,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And wrote letters by them after this maner, THE APOSTLES, and the Elders, and the brethren, vnto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antiochia, and in Syria, and in Cilicia, send greeting.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Forasmuch as we haue heard, that certaine which went out from vs, haue troubled you with wordes, and cumbred your mindes, saying, Ye must be circumcised and keepe the Lawe: to whom we gaue no such commandement,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>It seemed therefore good to vs, when we were come together with one accord, to send chosen men vnto you, with our beloued Barnabas and Paul,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Men that haue giuen vp their liues for the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>We haue therefore sent Iudas and Silas, which shall also tell you ye same things by mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For it seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to vs, to lay no more burden vpon you, then these necessary things,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>That is, that ye abstaine from things offered to idoles, and blood, and that that is strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keepe your selues, ye shall doe well. Fare ye well.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Nowe when they were departed, they came to Antiochia, and after that they had assembled the multitude, they deliuered the Epistle.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when they had read it, they reioyced for the consolation.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Iudas and Silas being Prophets, exhorted the brethren with many wordes, and strengthened them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And after they had taried there a space, they were let goe in peace of the brethren vnto the Apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Notwithstanding Silas thought good to abide there still.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antiochia, teaching and preaching with many other, the worde of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But after certaine dayes, Paul said vnto Barnabas, Let vs returne, and visite our brethren in euery citie, where we haue preached the worde of the Lord, and see how they doe.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Barnabas counselled to take with them Iohn, called Marke.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But Paul thought it not meete to take him vnto their companie, which departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the worke.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then were they so stirred, that they departed asunder one from the other, so that Barnabas tooke Marke, and sailed vnto Cyprus.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended of the brethren vnto the grace of God.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, stablishing the Churches. </div><ul class='tnav'>
