When her bough is yet tender, and it bringeth foorth leaues, ye knowe that sommer is neere.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So in like maner, when ye see these things come to passe, knowe that the kingdom of God is neere, euen at the doores.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto you, that this generation shall not passe, till all these things be done.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my woordes shall not passe away.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But of that day and houre knoweth no man, no, not the Angels which are in heauen, neither the Sonne himselfe, but the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Take heede: watch, and praie: for yee knowe not when the time is.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For the Sonne of man is as a man going into a strange countrey, and leaueth his house, and giueth authoritie to his seruaunts, and to euery man his woorke, and commandeth the porter to watch.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Watch ye therefore, (for ye know not whe ye master of the house will come, at eue, or at midnight, at the cocke crowing, or in the dawning,)  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Least if he come suddenly, he should finde you sleeping.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And those things that I say vnto you, I say vnto all men, Watch. </div><ul class='tnav'>
