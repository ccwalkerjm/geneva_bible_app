When thou walkest through the very fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle vpon thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Israel, thy Sauiour: I gaue Egypt for thy ransome, Ethiopia, and Seba for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Because thou wast precious in my sight, and thou wast honourable, and I loued thee, therefore will I giue man for thee, and people for thy sake.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Feare not, for I am with thee: I will bring thy seede from the East, and gather thee from the West.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will say to the North, Giue: and to the South, Keepe not backe: bring my sonnes from farre, and my daughters from the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Euery one shall be called by my Name: for I created him for my glorie, formed him and made him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I will bring foorth the blinde people, and they shall haue eyes, and the deafe, and they shall haue eares.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this and shewe vs former things? let them bring foorth their witnesses, that they may be iustified: but let them heare, and say, It is truth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my seruant, whom I haue chosen: therefore yee shall knowe and beleeue me and yee shall vnderstand that I am: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I, euen I am the Lord, and beside me there is no Sauiour.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I haue declared, and I haue saued, and I haue shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore you are my witnesses, sayeth the Lord, that I am God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yea, before the day was, I am, and there is none that can deliuer out of mine hand: I will doe it, and who shall let it?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord your redeemer, the holy one of Israel, For your sake I haue sent to Babel, and brought it downe: they are all fugitiues, and the Chaldeans crie in the shippes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I am the Lord your holy one, the creator of Israel, your King.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord which maketh a way in the Sea, and a path in the mighty waters.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When hee bringeth out the charet and horse, the armie and the power lie together, and shall not rise: they are extinct, and quenched as towe.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Remember yee not the former things, neither regard the things of olde.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, I do a new thing: now shall it come foorth: shall you not knowe it? I wil euen make a way in the desert, and floods in the wildernesse.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The wilde beastes shall honour mee, the dragons and the ostriches, because I gaue water in the desert, and floods in the wildernesse to giue drinke to my people, euen to mine elect.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This people haue I formed for my selfe: they shall shewe foorth my praise.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And thou hast not called vpon mee, O Iaakob, but thou hast wearied me, O Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thou hast not brought me the sheepe of thy burnt offrings, neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I haue not caused thee to serue with an offring, nor wearied thee with incense.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thou boughtest mee no sweete sauour with money, neither hast thou made mee drunke with the fatte of thy sacrifices, but thou hast made mee to serue with thy sinnes, and wearied mee with thine iniquities.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I, euen I am he that putteth away thine iniquities for mine owne sake, and will not remember thy sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Put me in remembrance: let vs be iudged together: count thou that thou maist be iustified.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers haue transgressed against me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore I haue prophaned the rulers of the Sanctuarie, and haue made Iaakob a curse, and Israel a reproche. </div><ul class='tnav'>
