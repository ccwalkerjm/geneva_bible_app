God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For if I build againe the things that I haue destroyed, I make my selfe a trespasser.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I through the Lawe am dead to the Lawe, that I might liue vnto God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I am crucified with Christ, but I liue, yet not I any more, but Christ liueth in me: and in that that I now liue in the flesh, I liue by the faith in the Sonne of God, who hath loued me, and giuen him selfe for me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I doe not abrogate the grace of God: for if righteousnes be by the Lawe, then Christ dyed without a cause. </div><ul class='tnav'>
