(for thou hast taught them to be captaines and as chiefe ouer thee) shall not sorow take thee as a woman in trauaile?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things vpon me? For the multitude of thine iniquities are thy skirts discouered and thy heeles made bare.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Can the blacke More change his skin? or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do euill.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that is taken away with the South winde.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>This is thy portion, and ye part of thy measures from me, sayth the Lord, because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in lyes.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore I haue also discouered thy skirts vpon thy face, that thy shame may appeare.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I haue seene thine adulteries, and thy neiings, the filthinesse of thy whoredome on the hils in the fieldes, and thine abominations. Wo vnto thee, O Ierusalem: wilt thou not bee made cleane? when shall it once be? </div><ul class='tnav'>
