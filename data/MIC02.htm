They shall not prophecie to them, neither shall they take shame.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>O thou that art named of the house of Iaakob, is the Spirite of the Lord shortened? are these his workes? are not my wordes good vnto him that walketh vprightly?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But hee that was yesterday my people, is risen vp on the other side, as against an enemie: they spoyle the beautifull garment from them that passe by peaceably, as though they returned from the warre.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The women of my people haue ye cast out from their pleasant houses, and from their childre haue ye taken away my glorie continually.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Arise and depart, for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, euen with a sore destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If a man walke in the Spirit, and would lie falsely, saying, I wil prophecie vnto thee of wine, and of strong drinke, he shall euen be the prophet of this people.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will surely gather thee wholy, O Iaakob: I will surely gather the remnant of Israel: I will put them together as the sheepe of Bozrah, euen as the flocke in the mids of their folde: the cities shall be full of brute of the men.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The breaker vp shall come vp before them: they shall breake out, and passe by the gate, and goe out by it, and their King shall goe before them, and the Lord shalbe vpon their heades. </div><ul class='tnav'>
