Againe she sayde, No, but thy sonne is dead, and mine aliue: thus they spake before the King.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then sayde the King, She sayth, This that liueth is my sonne, and the dead is thy sonne: and the other sayth, Nay, but the dead is thy sonne, and the liuing is my sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the King said, Bring me a sworde: and they brought out a sworde before the King.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the King sayde, Deuide ye the liuing child in twaine, and giue the one halfe to the one, and the other halfe to the other.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then spake the woman, whose the liuing child was, vnto the King, for her compassion was kindled toward her sonne, and she sayde, Oh my lorde, giue her the liuing childe, and slay him not: but the other sayde, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but deuide it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the King answered, and sayde, Giue her the liuing childe, and slay him not: this is his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And all Israel heard the iudgement, which the King had iudged, and they feared the King: for they sawe that the wisedome of God was in him to doe iustice. </div><ul class='tnav'>
