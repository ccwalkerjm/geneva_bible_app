So Ionah was exceeding glad of the gourde.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But God prepared a worme when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when the sunne did arise, God prepared also a feruent East winde: and the sunne beat vpon the head of Ionah, that he fainted, and wished in his heart to die, and said, It is better for me to dye, then to liue.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And God said vnto Ionah, Doest thou well to be angrie for the gourde? And he said, I doe well to be angrie vnto the death.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pitie on the gourde for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it growe, which came vp in a night, and perished in a night,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And shoulde not I spare Nineueh that great citie, wherein are sixe score thousande persons, that cannot discerne betweene their right hand, and their left hand, and also much cattell? </div><ul class='tnav'>
