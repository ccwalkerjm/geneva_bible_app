<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I Demaund then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid: for I also am an Israelite, of the seede of Abraham, of the tribe of Beniamin.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God hath not cast away his people which he knew before. Know ye not what the Scripture sayth of Elias, howe hee communeth with God against Israel, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Lord, they haue killed thy Prophets, and digged downe thine altars: and I am left alone, and they seeke my life?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But what saith the answere of God to him? I haue reserued vnto my selfe seuen thousand men, which haue not bowed the knee to Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Euen so then at this present time is there a remnant according to the election of grace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And if it be of grace, it is no more of workes: or els were grace no more grace: but if it be of workes, it is no more grace: or els were worke no more worke.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What then? Israel hath not obtained that he sought: but the election hath obteined it, and the rest haue bene hardened,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>According as it is written, God hath giuen them the spirit of slumber: eyes that they should not see, and eares that they should not heare vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Dauid sayth, Let their table be made a snare, and a net, and a stumbling blocke, euen for a recompence vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let their eyes be darkened that they see not, and bowe downe their backe alwayes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I demaund then, Haue they stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid: but through their fall, saluation commeth vnto the Gentiles, to prouoke them to follow them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wherefore if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their aboundance be?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For in that I speake to you Gentiles, in as much as I am the Apostle of ye Gentiles, I magnifie mine office,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>To trie if by any meanes I might prouoke them of my flesh to follow them, and might saue some of them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiuing be, but life from the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For if the first fruites be holy, so is the whole lumpe: and if the roote be holy, so are the branches.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And though some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wilde Oliue tree, wast graft in for them, and made partaker of the roote, and fatnesse of the Oliue tree.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Boast not thy selfe against the branches: and if thou boast thy selfe, thou bearest not the roote, but the roote thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou wilt say then, The branches are broken off, that I might be graft in.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Well: through vnbeliefe they are broken off, and thou standest by faith: bee not hie minded, but feare.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For if God spared not the naturall branches, take heede, least he also spare not thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Beholde therefore the bountifulnesse, and seueritie of God: towarde them which haue fallen, seueritie: but toward thee, bountifulnesse, if thou continue in his bountifulnesse: or els thou shalt also be cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they also, if they abide not still in vnbeliefe, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graffe them in againe.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For if thou wast cut out of the Oliue tree, which was wilde by nature, and wast graffed contrary to nature in a right Oliue tree, how much more shall they that are by nature, bee graffed in their owne Oliue tree?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this secret (least ye should bee arrogant in your selues) that partly obstinacie is come to Israel, vntill the fulnesse of the Gentiles be come in.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And so all Israel shalbe saued, as it is written, The deliuerer shall come out of Sion, and shall turne away the vngodlinesse from Iacob.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And this is my couenant to them, When I shall take away their sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloued for the fathers sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For the giftes and calling of God are without repentance.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For euen as yee in times past haue not beleeued God, yet haue nowe obteined mercie through their vnbeliefe:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Euen so nowe haue they not beleeued by the mercie shewed vnto you, that they also may obtaine mercie.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For God hath shut vp all in vnbeliefe, that he might haue mercie on all.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>O the deepenesse of the riches, both of the wisdome, and knowledge of God! howe vnsearcheable are his iudgements, and his wayes past finding out!  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For who hath knowen the minde of the Lord? or who was his counsellour?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Or who hath giuen vnto him first, and he shalbe recompensed?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for euer. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
