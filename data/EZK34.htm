I the Lord haue spoken it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will make with them a couenant of peace, and will cause the euil beastes to cease out of the land: and they shall dwel safely in the wildernesse, and sleepe in the woods.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I wil set them, as a blessing, euen roud about my mountaine: and I will cause rayne to come downe in due season, and there shalbe raine of blessing.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the tree of the fielde shall yeeld her fruite, and the earth shall giue her fruite, and they shalbe safe in their land, and shall know that I am the Lord, when I haue broken the cordes of their yoke, and deliuered them out of the hands of those that serued themselues of them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they shall no more be spoyled of the heathen, neither shall the beastes of the land deuoure them, but they shall dwell safely and none shall make them afrayd.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And I will rayse vp for them a plant of renoume, and they shalbe no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither beare the reproche of the heathen any more.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thus shall they vnderstande, that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, euen the house of Israel, are my people, sayth the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And yee my sheepe, the sheepe of my pasture are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
