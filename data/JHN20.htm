She said vnto them, They haue taken away my Lord, and I know not where they haue laide him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When she had thus said, she turned her selfe backe, and sawe Iesus standing, and knewe not that it was Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She supposing that he had bene the gardener, said vnto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Iesus saith vnto her, Marie. She turned her selfe, and said vnto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Iesus saith vnto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but goe to my brethren, and say vnto them, I ascend vnto my Father, and to your Father, and to my God, and your God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Marie Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seene the Lord, and that he had spoken these things vnto her.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The same day then at night, which was the first day of the weeke, and when the doores were shut where the disciples were assembled for feare of the Iewes, came Iesus and stoode in the middes, and saide to them, Peace be vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when he had so saide, he shewed vnto them his handes, and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they had seene the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then saide Iesus to them againe, Peace be vnto you: as my Father sent me, so sende I you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when he had saide that, he breathed on them, and saide vnto them, Receiue the holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whosoeuers sinnes ye remit, they are remitted vnto them: and whosoeuers sinnes ye reteine, they are reteined.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Thomas one of the twelue, called Didymus, was not with them when Iesus came.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The other disciples therefore saide vnto him, We haue seene the Lord: but he said vnto them, Except I see in his handes the print of the nailes, and put my finger into the print of the nailes, and put mine hand into his side, I will not beleeue it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And eight dayes after, againe his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Iesus, when the doores were shut, and stood in the middes, and said, Peace be vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>After saide he to Thomas, Put thy finger here, and see mine hands, and put forth thine hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but faithfull.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Thomas answered, and said vnto him, Thou art my Lord, and my God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Iesus said vnto him, Thomas, because thou hast seene me, thou beleeuest: blessed are they that haue not seene, and haue beleeued.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And many other signes also did Iesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this booke.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But these things are written, that ye might beleeue, that Iesus is that Christ that Sonne of God, and that in beleeuing ye might haue life through his Name. </div><ul class='tnav'>
