As the whirlewindes in the South vse to passe from the wildernesse, so shall it come from the horrible land.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>A grieuous vision was shewed vnto me, The transgressour against a transgressour, and the destroyer against a destroyer. Goe vp Elam, besiege Media: I haue caused all the mourning thereof to cease.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore are my loynes filled with sorow: sorowes haue taken me as the sorowes of a woman that trauayleth: I was bowed downe when I heard it, and I was amased when I sawe it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Mine heart failed: fearefulnesse troubled me: the night of my pleasures hath he turned into feare vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Prepare thou the table: watch in the watch towre: eate, drinke: arise, ye princes, anoynt the shielde.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For thus hath the Lord said vnto me, Go, set a watchman, to tell what he seeth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he sawe a charet with two horsemen: a charet of an asse, and a charet of a camel: and he hearkened and tooke diligent heede.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he cryed, A lyon: my lorde, I stand continually vpon ye watche towre in the day time, and I am set in my watche euery night:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And beholde, this mans charet commeth with two horsemen. And he answered and said, Babel is fallen: it is fallen, and all the images of her gods hath he broken vnto the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>O my threshing, and the corne of my floore. That which I haue heard of the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, haue I shewed vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The burden of Dumah. He calleth vnto me out of Seir, Watchman, what was in ye night? Watchman, what was in the night?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The watchman saide, The morning commeth, and also the night. If yee will aske, enquire: returne and come.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The burden against Arabia. In the forest of Arabia shall yee tarie all night, euen in the waies of Dedanim.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>O inhabitants of the lande of Tema, bring foorth water to meete the thirstie, and preuent him that fleeth with his bread.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For they flee from the drawen swords, euen from the drawen sword, and from the bent bowe, and from the grieuousnesse of warre.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For thus hath the Lord sayd vnto me, Yet a yeere according to the yeeres of an hireling, and all the glorie of Kedar shall faile.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the residue of the nomber of ye strong archers of the sonnes of Kedar shall be fewe: for the Lord God of Israel hath spoken it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
