Nowe Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsemen, and special friends.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to passe as Peter came in, that Cornelius met him, and fell downe at his feete, and worshipped him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But Peter tooke him vp, saying, Stand vp: for euen I my selfe am a man.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And as he talked with him, he came in, and found many that were come together.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he sayd vnto them, Ye know that it is an vnlawfull thing for a man that is a Iewe, to company, or come vnto one of another nation: but God hath shewed me, that I should not call any man polluted, or vncleane.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Therefore came I vnto you without saying nay, when I was sent for. I aske therefore, for what intent haue ye sent for me?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Cornelius sayd, Foure dayes agoe, about this houre, I fasted, and at the ninth houre I prayed in mine house, and beholde, a man stood before me in bright clothing,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And sayd, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine almes are had in remembrance in the sight of God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Send therefore to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter (he is lodged in the house of Simon a Tanner by the sea side) who when he commeth, shall speake vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then sent I for thee immediately, and thou hast well done to come. Nowe therefore are we all here present before God, to heare all things that are commanded thee of God.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then Peter opened his mouth, and sayd, Of a trueth I perceiue, that God is no accepter of persons.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But in euery nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousnesse, is accepted with him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Ye know the worde which God hath sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Iesus Christ, which is Lord of all:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Euen the worde which came through all Iudea, beginning in Galile, after the baptisme which Iohn preached.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>To wit, howe God anointed Iesus of Nazareth with the holy Ghost, and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the deuill: for God was with him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Iewes, and in Hierusalem, whom they slewe, hanging him on a tree.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Him God raysed vp the third day, and caused that he was shewed openly:  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Not to all the people, but vnto the witnesses chosen before of God, euen to vs which did eate and drinke with him, after he arose from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie, that it is he that is ordained of God a iudge of quicke and dead.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>To him also giue all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name all that beleeue in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>While Peter yet spake these wordes, the holy Ghost fell on al them which heard the word.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>So they of the circumcision which beleeued, were astonied, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was powred out the gift of the holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For they heard them speake with tongues, and magnifie God. Then answered Peter,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which haue receiued the holy Ghost, as well as we?  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>So he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tary certaine dayes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
