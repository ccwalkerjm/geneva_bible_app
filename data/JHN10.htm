If thou be that Christ, tell vs plainely.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Iesus answered them, I tolde you, and ye beleeue not: the workes that I doe in my Fathers Name, they beare witnes of me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But ye beleeue not: for ye are not of my sheepe, as I sayd vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>My sheepe heare my voyce, and I knowe them, and they follow me,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I giue vnto them eternall life, and they shall neuer perish, neither shall any plucke them out of mine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>My Father which gaue them me, is greater then all, and none is able to take them out of my Fathers hand.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I and my Father are one.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then ye Iewes againe tooke vp stones, to stone him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Iesus answered them, Many good workes haue I shewed you from my Father: for which of these workes doe ye stone me?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The Iewes answered him, saying, For the good worke we stone thee not, but for blasphemie, and that thou being a man, makest thy selfe God.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Iesus answered them, Is it not written in your Lawe, I sayd, Ye are gods?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>If hee called them gods, vnto whome the worde of God was giuen, and the Scripture cannot be broken,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Say ye of him, whome the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the worlde, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Sonne of God?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>If I doe not the workes of my Father, beleeue me not.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But if I doe, then though ye beleeue not mee, yet beleeue the workes, that ye may knowe and beleeue, that the Father is in me, and I in him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Againe they went about to take him: but he escaped out of their handes,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And went againe beyonde Iordan, into the place where Iohn first baptized, and there abode.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And many resorted vnto him, and saide, Iohn did no miracle: but all thinges that Iohn spake of this man, were true.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And many beleeued in him there. </div><ul class='tnav'>
