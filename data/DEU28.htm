commandements, which I commande thee this day, then the Lord thy God wil set thee on high aboue all the nations of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And all these blessings shall come on thee, and ouertake thee, if thou shalt obey the voyce of the Lord thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Blessed shalt thou be in the citie, and blessed also in the fielde.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Blessed shalbe the fruite of thy body, and ye fruite of thy ground, and the fruite of thy cattel, the increase of thy kine, and ye flocks of thy sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Blessed shalbe thy basket and thy dough.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Blessed shalt thou be, whe thou commest in, and blessed also when thou goest out.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise against thee, to fall before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and shall flee before thee leuen wayes.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord shall command the blessing to be with thee in thy store houses, and in all that thou settest thine hande to, and wil blesse thee in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Lord shall make thee an holy people vnto himself, as he hath sworne vnto thee, if thou shalt keepe the commandements of the Lord thy God, and walke in his wayes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then all people of the earth shall see that the Name of the Lord is called vpon ouer thee, and they shalbe afrayde of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruite of thy body, and in the fruite of thy cattell, and in the fruite of thy grounde, in the land which the Lord sware vnto thy fathers, to giue thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Lord shall open vnto thee his good treasure, euen the heauen to giue rayne vnto thy kind in due season, and to blesse all the worke of thine handes: and thou shalt lende vnto many nations, but shalt not borow thy selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tayle, and thou shalt be aboue onely, and shalt not bee beneath, if thou obey the commandements of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to keepe and to do them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But thou shalt not decline from any of the wordes, which I command you this day, either to the right hand or to the left, to goe after other gods to serue them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But if thou wilt not obey the voyce of the Lord thy God, to keepe and to do all his commandementes and his ordinances, which I command thee this day, then al these curses shall come vpon thee, and ouertake thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Cursed shalt thou bee in the towne, and cursed also in the fielde.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Cursed shall thy basket be, and thy dough.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Cursed shall be the fruite of thy body, and the fruite of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flockes of thy sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Cursed shalt thou be when thou commest in, and cursed also when thou goest out.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The Lord shall sende vpon thee cursing, trouble, and shame, in all that which thou settest thine hand to do, vntil thou be destroyed, and perish quickely, because of the wickednesse of thy workes whereby thou hast forsaken me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Lord shall make the pestilence cleaue vnto thee, vntill he hath consumed thee from the land, whither thou goest to possesse it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with the feuer, and with a burning ague, and with feruent heate, and with the sworde, and with blasting, and with the mildew, and they shall pursue thee vntill thou perish.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And thine heauen that is ouer thine head, shall be brasse, and the earth that is vnder thee, yron.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Lord shall giue thee for the rayne of thy land, dust and ashes: euen from heauen shall it come downe vpon thee, vntil thou be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the Lord shall cause thee to fall before thine enemies: thou shalt come out one way against them, and shalt flee seuen wayes before them, and shalt be scattered through all the kingdomes of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And thy carkeis shall be meate vnto all foules of the ayre, and vnto the beasts of the earth, and none shall fray them away.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The Lord wil smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emeroids, and with the skab, and with the itche, that thou canst not be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And ye Lord shall smite thee with madnes, and with blindnes, and with astonying of heart.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Thou shalt also grope at noone daies, as the blinde gropeth in darknes, and shalt not prosper in thy wayes: thou shalt neuer but bee oppressed with wrong and be powled euermore, and no man shall succour thee.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lye with her: thou shalt builde an house, and shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not eate the fruite.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Thine oxe shalbe slayne before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eate thereof: thine asse shall be violently taken away before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheepe shalbe giuen vnto thine enemies, and no man shall rescue them for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thy sonnes and thy daughters shalbe giuen vnto another people, and thine eyes shall still looke for them, euen till they fall out, and there shalbe no power in thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The fruite of thy land and all thy labours shall a people, which thou knowest not, eate, and thou shalt neuer but suffer wrong, and violence alway:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So that thou shalt be madde for the sight which thine eyes shall see.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Lord shall smite thee in the knees, and in the thighes, with a sore botche, that thou canst not be healed: euen from the sole of thy foote vnto the top of thine head.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The Lord shall bring thee and thy King (which thou shalt set ouer thee) vnto a nation, which neither thou nor thy fathers haue knowen, and there thou shalt serue other gods: euen wood and stone,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And thou shalt be a wonder, a prouerbe and a common talke among all people, whither the Lord shall carie thee.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Thou shalt carie out much seede into the fielde, and shalt gather but litle in: for the grashoppers shall destroy it.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Thou shalt plant a vineyard, and dresse it, but shalt neither drinke of the wine, nor gather the grapes: for the wormes shall eate it.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Thou shalt haue Oliue trees in all thy coastes, but shalt not anoynt thy selfe with the oyle: for thine oliues shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Thou shalt beget sonnes, and daughters, but shalt not haue them: for they shall goe into captiuitie.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>All thy trees and fruite of thy land shall the grashopper consume.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>The straunger that is among you, shall clime aboue thee vp on hie, and thou shalt come downe beneath alow.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>He shall lend thee, and thou shalt not lend him: he shalbe the head, and thou shalt be ye tayle.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Moreouer, all these curses shall come vpon thee, and shall pursue thee and ouertake thee, till thou be destroyed, because thou obeyedst not the voyce of the Lord thy God, to keepe his commandements, and his ordinances, which he commanded thee:  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And they shalbe vpon thee for signes and wonders, and vpon thy seede for euer,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Because thou seruedst not the Lord thy God with ioyfulnesse and with a good heart for the abundance of all things.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Therefore thou shalt serue thine enemies which the Lord shall send vpon thee, in hunger and in thirst, and in nakednesse, and in neede of all things? and he shall put a yoke of yron vpon thy necke vntill he haue destroyed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The Lord shall bring a nation vpon thee from farre, euen from the ende of the world, flying swift as an Egle: a nation whose tongue thou shalt not vnderstand:  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>A nation of a fierce countenance, which will not regarde the person of the olde, nor haue compassion of the yong.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>The same shall eate the fruit of thy cattell, and the fruite of thy land vntill thou be destroyed, and he shall leaue thee neyther wheate, wine, nor oyle, neither the increase of thy kyne, nor the flockes of thy sheepe, vntill he haue brought thee to nought.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And he shall besiege thee in all thy cities, vntill thine hie and strong walles fall downe, wherein thou trustedst in all the lande: and hee shall besiege thee in all thy cities throughout all thy lande, which the Lord thy God hath giuen thee.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And thou shalt eate the fruite of thy bodie: euen the flesh of thy sonnes and thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath giuen thee, during the siege and straitnesse wherein thine enemie shall inclose thee:  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>So that the man (that is tender and exceeding deintie among you) shalbe grieued at his brother, and at his wife, that lieth in his bosome, and at the remnant of his children, which hee hath yet left,  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>For feare of giuing vnto any of them of the flesh of his children, whom he shall eate, because he hath nothing left him in that siege, and straitnesse, wherewith thine enemie shall besiege thee in all thy cities.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>The tender and deintie woman among you, which neuer woulde venture to set the sole of her foote vpon the grounde (for her softnesse and tendernesse) shalbe grieued at her husband that lieth in her bosome, and at her sonne, and at her daughter,  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And at her afterbirth (that shall come out from betweene her feete) and at her childre, which she shall beare: for when all things lacke, she shall eate them secretly, during the siege and straitnesse, wherewith thine enemie shall besiege thee in thy cities.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>If thou wilt not keepe and doe all the wordes of the Lawe (that are written in this booke) and feare this glorious and feareful name The Lord Thy God,  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>The the Lord wil make thy plagues wonderfull, and the plagues of thy seede, euen great plagues and of long continuance, and sore diseases, and of long durance.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Moreouer, he will bring vpon thee all the diseases of Egypt, whereof thou wast afraide, and they shall cleaue vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And euery sickenesse, and euery plague, which is not written in the booke of this Lawe, will the Lord heape vpon thee, vntill thou be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And ye shall be left few in nomber, where ye were as the starres of heauen in multitude, because thou wouldest not obey the voyce of the Lord thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And as the Lord hath reioyced ouer you, to doe you good, and to multiply you, so he will reioyce ouer you, to destroy you, and bring you to nought, and ye shalbe rooted out of the land, whither thou goest to possesse it.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one ende of the worlde vnto the other, and there thou shalt serue other gods, which thou hast not knowen nor thy fathers, euen wood and stone.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Also among these nations thou shalt finde no rest, neither shall the sole of thy foote haue rest: for the Lord shall giue thee there a trembling heart, and looking to returne till thine eyes fall out, and a sorowfull minde.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And thy life shall hang before thee, and thou shalt feare both night and day, and shalt haue none assurance of thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>In the morning thou shalt say, Woulde God it were euening, and at the euening thou shalt say, Would God it were morning, for ye feare of thine heart, which thou shalt feare, and for the sight of thine eyes, which thou shalt see.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt againe with shippes by the way, whereof I saide vnto thee, Thou shalt see it no more againe: and there yee shall sell your selues vnto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and there shalbe no byer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
