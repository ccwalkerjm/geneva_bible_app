will not you, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego serue my god, nor worship the golden image, that I haue set vp?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now therefore are ye ready when ye heare the sound of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, sackebut, psalterie, and dulcimer, and all instruments of musike, to fall downe, and worship the image, which I haue made? for if ye worship it not, ye shall be cast immediatly into the middes of an hote fierie fornace: for who is that God, that can deliuer you out of mine handes?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the King, O Nebuchad-nezzar, we are not carefull to answere thee in this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Beholde, our God whom we serue, is able to deliuer vs from the hote fierie fornace, and hee will deliuer vs out of thine hand, O King.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if not, bee it knowen to thee, O King, that wee will not serue thy gods, nor worship the golden image, which thou hast set vp.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then was Nebuchad-nezzar full of rage, and the forme of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore hee charged and commanded that they should heate the fornace at once seuen times more then it was wont to be heat.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And hee charged the most valiant men of warre that were in his armie, to binde Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the hote fierie fornace.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So these men were bounde in their coates, their hosen, and their clokes, with their other garments, and cast into the middes of the hote fierie fornace.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore, because the Kings commandement was straite, that the fornace should be exceeding hote, the flame of the fire slew those men that brought foorth Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And these three men Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego fell downe bound into the middes of the hote fierie fornace.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Nebuchad-nezzar the King was astonied and rose vp in haste, and spake, and saide vnto his counsellers, Did not wee cast three men bound into the middes of the fire? Who answered and said vnto the King, It is true, O King.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he answered, and said, Loe, I see foure men loose, walking in the middes of the fire, and they haue no hurt, and the forme of the fourth is like the sonne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the King Nebuchad-nezzar came neere to the mouth of the hote fierie fornace, and spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, the seruants of the hie God goe foorth and come hither: so Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came foorth of the middes of the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the nobles, princes and dukes, and the Kings counsellers came together to see these men, because the fire had no power ouer their bodies: for not an heare of their head was burnt, neither was their coates changed, nor any smelll of fire came vpon them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Wherefore Nebuchad-nezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who hath sent his Angel, and deliuered his seruants, that put their trust in him, and haue changed the Kings commandement, and yeelded their bodies rather then they would serue or worship any god, saue their owne God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Therefore I make a decree, that euery people, nation, and language, which speake any blasphemie against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, shalbe drawen in pieces, and their houses shall be made a iakes, because there is no god that can deliuer after this sort.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the King promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the prouince of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Nebuchad-nezzar King vnto all people, nations and languages, that dwell in all the world, Peace be multiplied vnto you:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I thought it good to declare the signes and wonders, that the hie God hath wrought toward me.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>How great are his signes, and how mightie are his wonders! his kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome, and his dominion is from generation to generation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
