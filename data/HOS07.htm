Ephraim is as a cake on the hearth not turned.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Strangers haue deuoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray heares are here and there vpon him, yet he knoweth not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face, and they doe not returne to the Lord their God, nor seeke him for all this.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Ephraim also is like a doue deceiued, without heart: they call to Egypt: they go to Asshur.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when they shall go, I will spred my net vpon them, and drawe them downe as the foules of the heauen: I will chastice them as their congregation hath heard.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Wo vnto them: for they haue fled away from me: destruction shalbe vnto them, because they haue transgressed against me: though I haue redeemed them, yet they haue spoken lyes against me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they haue not cryed vnto me with their hearts, when they houled vpon their beds: they assembled themselues for corne, and wine, and they rebell against me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Though I haue boud and strengthened their arme, yet doe they imagine mischiefe against me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They returne, but not to the most high: they are like a deceitfull bowe: their princes shall fall by the sword, for the rage of their tongues: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt. </div><ul class='tnav'>
