(Nowe there was much grasse in that place.) Then the men sate downe in nomber, about fiue thousande.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Iesus tooke the bread, and gaue thanks, and gaue to the disciples, and the disciples, to them that were set downe: and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when they were satisfied, he said vnto his disciples, Gather vp the broken meat which remaineth, that nothing be lost.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then they gathered it together, and filled twelue baskets with the broken meat of the fiue barly loaues, which remained vnto them that had eaten.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the men, when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did, saide, This is of a trueth that Prophet that should come into the world.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When Iesus therfore perceiued that they would come, and take him to make him a King, hee departed againe into a mountaine himselfe alone.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When euen was nowe come, his disciples went downe vnto the sea,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And entred into a shippe, and went ouer the sea, towardes Capernaum: and nowe it was darke, and Iesus was not come to them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Sea arose with a great winde that blewe.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when they had rowed about fiue and twentie, or thirtie furlongs, they sawe Iesus walking on the sea, and drawing neere vnto the ship: so they were afraide.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But he said vnto them, It is I: be not afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then willingly they receiued him into the ship, and the ship was by and by at the lande, whither they went.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The day following, the people which stoode on the other side of the sea, saw that there was none other ship there, saue that one, whereinto his disciples were entred, and that Iesus went not with his disciples in the ship, but that his disciples were gone alone,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And that there came other ships from Tiberias neere vnto the place where they ate the bread, after the Lord had giuen thankes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Nowe when the people sawe that Iesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also tooke shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when they had founde him on the other side of the sea, they sayde vnto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Iesus answered them; and sayde, Verely, verely I say vnto you, ye seeke me not because ye sawe the miracles, but because yee ate of ye loaues, and were filled.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Labour not for ye meate which perisheth, but for the meate that endureth vnto euerlasting life, which the Sonne of man shall giue vnto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then sayde they vnto him, What shall we doe, that we might worke the workes of God?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them, This is the woorke of God, that yee beleeue in him, whome he hath sent.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They sayde therefore vnto him, What signe shewest thou then, that we may see it, and beleeue thee? what doest thou woorke?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Our fathers did eate Manna in the desart, as it is written, Hee gaue them bread from heauen to eate.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then Iesus said vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, Moses gaue you not that bread from heauen, but my Father giueth you that true bread from heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For the breade of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen, and giueth life vnto the world.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then they said vnto him, Lord, euermore giue vs this bread.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Iesus saide vnto them, I am that bread of life: he that commeth to me, shall not hunger, and he that beleeueth in me, shall neuer thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But I said vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and beleeue not.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>All that the Father giueth me, shall come to mee: and him that commeth to me, I cast not away.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For I came downe from heauen, not to do mine owne wil, but his wil which hath sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And this is the Fathers will which hath sent mee, that of all which hee hath giuen mee, I should lose nothing, but shoulde raise it vp againe at the last day.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And this is the will of him that sent mee, that euery man which seeth the Sonne, and beleeueth in him, should haue euerlasting life: and I will raise him vp at the last day.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The Iewes then murmured at him because hee sayde, I am that bread, which is come downe from heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they said, Is not this Iesus that sonne of Ioseph, whose father and mother wee knowe? howe then sayth he, I came downe from heauen?  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Iesus then answered, and saide vnto them, Murmure not among your selues.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>No man can come to mee, except the Father, which hath sent mee, drawe him: and I will raise him vp at the last day.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>It is written in the Prophetes, And they shalbe al taught of God. Euery man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, commeth vnto me:  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Not that any man hath seene the Father, saue hee which is of God, hee hath seene the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Verely, verely I say vnto you, hee that beleeueth in me, hath euerlasting life.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>I am that bread of life.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse, and are dead.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>This is that breade, which commeth downe from heauen, that hee which eateth of it, shoulde not die.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>I am that liuing breade, which came downe from heauen: if any man eate of this breade, hee shall liue for euer: and the bread that I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then the Iewes stroue among themselues, saying, Howe can this man giue vs his flesh to eate?  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Then Iesus saide vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, Except yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee haue no life in you.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Whosoeuer eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raise him vp at the last day.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>For my flesh is meat in deede, and my blood is drinke in deede.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Hee that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>As that liuing Father hath sent me, so liue I by the Father, and he that eateth me, euen he shall liue by me.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>This is that bread which came downe from heauen: not as your fathers haue eaten Manna, and are deade. Hee that eateth of this bread, shall liue for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>These things spake he in the Synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Many therefore of his disciples (when they heard this) sayde, This is an hard saying: who can heare it?  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>But Iesus knowing in himselfe, that his disciples murmured at this, saide vnto them, Doeth this offend you?  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>What then if yee should see that Sonne of man ascend vp where he was before?  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>It is the spirite that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing: the woordes that I speake vnto you, are spirite and life.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>But there are some of you that beleeue not: for Iesus knewe from the beginning, which they were that beleeued not, and who shoulde betray him.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And hee saide, Therefore saide I vnto you, that no man can come vnto mee, except it be giuen vnto him of my Father.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>From that time, many of his disciples went backe, and walked no more with him.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Then sayde Iesus to the twelue, Will yee also goe away?  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>Then Simon Peter answered him, Master, to whome shall we goe? thou hast the wordes of eternall life:  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And we beleeue and knowe that thou art that Christ that Sonne of the liuing God.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>Iesus answered them, Haue not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a deuill?  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>Now he spake it of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon: for hee it was that shoulde betraie him, though he was one of the twelue. </div><ul class='tnav'>
