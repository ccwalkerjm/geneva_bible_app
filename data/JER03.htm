Behold, we come vnto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Truely the hope of the hilles is but vaine, nor the multitude of mountaines: but in the Lord our God is the health of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For confusion hath deuoured our fathers labour, from our youth their sheepe and their bullocks, their sonnes and their daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Wee lie downe in our confusion, and our shame couereth vs: for we haue sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers from our youth, euen vnto this day, and haue not obeyed the voyce of the Lord our God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
