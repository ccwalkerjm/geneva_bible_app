Then the seruants saide vnto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them vp?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But he saide, Nay, lest while yee goe about to gather the tares, yee plucke vp also with them the wheat.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Let both growe together vntill the haruest, and in time of haruest I will say to the reapers, Gather yee first the tares, and binde them in sheaues to burne them: but gather the wheate into my barne.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Another parable he put foorth vnto them, saying, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a graine of mustard seede, which a man taketh and soweth in his fielde:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Which in deede is the least of all seedes: but when it is growen, it is the greatest among herbes, and it is a tree, so that the birdes of heauen come and builde in the branches thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Another parable spake hee to them, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto leauen, which a woman taketh and hideth in three pecks of meale, till all be leauened.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>All these thinges spake Iesus vnto the multitude in parables, and without parables spake he not to them,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, and will vtter the thinges which haue beene kept secrete from the foundation of the worlde.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then sent Iesus the multitude away, and went into the house. And his disciples came vnto him, saying, Declare vnto vs the parable of the tares of that fielde.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then answered he, and saide to them, He that soweth the good seede, is the Sonne of man.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the field is the worlde, and the good seede are the children of the kingdome, and the tares are the children of that wicked one.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the enemie that soweth them, is the deuill, and the haruest is the end of the worlde, and the reapers be the Angels.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>As then the tares are gathered and burned in ye fire, so shall it be in the end of this world.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The Sonne of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which doe iniquitie,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And shall cast them into a fornace of fire. There shalbe wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then shall the iust men shine as ye sunne in the kingdome of their Father. Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Againe, the kingdom of heauen is like vnto a treasure hid in ye field, which when a man hath found, he hideth it, and for ioy thereof departeth and selleth all that he hath, and buieth that field.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like to a marchant man, that seeketh good pearles,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Who hauing found a pearle of great price, went and solde all that he had, and bought it.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Againe, the kingdom of heauen is like vnto a drawe net cast into the sea, that gathereth of all kindes of things.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Which, when it is full, men draw to lande, and sit and gather the good into vessels, and cast the bad away.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>So shall it be at the end of the world. The Angels shall goe foorth, and seuer the bad from among the iust,  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And shall cast them into a fornace of fire: there shalbe wailing, and gnashing of teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Iesus saide vnto them, Vnderstand yee all these things? They saide vnto him, Yea, Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then sayd hee vnto them, Therefore euery Scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome of heauen, is like vnto an householder, which bringeth foorth out of his treasure things both newe and olde.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And it came to passe, that when Iesus had ended these parables, he departed thence,  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And came into his owne countrey, and taught them in their Synagogue, so that they were astonied, and saide, Whence commeth this wisdome and great woorkes vnto this man?  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Is not this the carpenters sonne? Is not his mother called Marie, and his brethren Iames and Ioses, and Simon and Iudas?  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And are not his sisters all with vs? Whence then hath he all these things?  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they were offended with him. Then Iesus said to them, A Prophet is not without honour, saue in his owne countrey, and in his owne house.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And he did not many great woorkes there, for their vnbeliefes sake. </div><ul class='tnav'>
