And hee answered, and sayde vnto him, Thou sayest it.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the hie Priestes accused him of many things.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wherefore Pilate asked him againe, saying, Answerest thou nothing? beholde howe many things they witnesse against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But Iesus answered no more at all, so that Pilate marueiled.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Nowe at the feast, Pilate did deliuer a prisoner vnto them, whomesoeuer they woulde desire.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then there was one named Barabbas, which was bounde with his fellowes, that had made insurrection, who in the insurrection had committed murder.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the people cried aloude, and began to desire that he woulde doe as he had euer done vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Pilate answered them, and said, Will ye that I let loose vnto you the King of ye Iewes?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For he knewe that the hie Priestes had deliuered him of enuie.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the high Priestes had moued the people to desire that he would rather deliuer Barabbas vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Pilate answered, and said againe vnto them, What will ye then that I doe with him, whom ye call the King of the Iewes?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they cried againe, Crucifie him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Pilate said vnto them, But what euill hath he done? And they cryed the more feruently, Crucifie him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So Pilate willing to content the people, loosed them Barabbas, and deliuered Iesus, when he had scourged him, that he might be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then the souldiers led him away into the hall, which is the common hall, and called together the whole band,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And clad him with purple, and platted a crowne of thornes, and put it about his head,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And began to salute him, saying, Haile, King of the Iewes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they smote him on the head with a reede, and spat vpon him, and bowed the knees, and did him reuerence.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And whe they had mocked him, they tooke the purple off him, and put his owne clothes on him, and led him out to crucifie him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they compelled one that passed by, called Simon of Cyrene (which came out of the countrey, and was father of Alexander and Rufus) to beare his crosse.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they brought him to a place named Golgotha, which is by interpretation, the place of dead mens skulles.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they gaue him to drinke wine mingled with myrrhe: but he receiued it not.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots for them, what euery man should haue.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it was the third houre, when they crucified him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And ye title of his cause was written aboue, THAT KING OF THE JEWES.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They crucified also with him two theeues, the one on ye right hand, and the other on his left.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thus the Scripture was fulfilled, which sayth, And he was counted among the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they that went by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Hey, thou that destroyest the Temple, and buildest it in three dayes,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Saue thy selfe, and come downe from the crosse.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Likewise also euen the hie Priests mocking, said among themselues with the Scribes, He saued other men, himselfe he cannot saue.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Let Christ the King of Israel nowe come downe from the crosse, that we may see, and beleeue. They also that were crucified with him, reuiled him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Nowe when the sixt houre was come, darkenesse arose ouer all the land vntill the ninth houre.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And at the ninth houre Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lamma-sabachthani? which is by interpretation, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And some of them that stoode by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And one ranne, and filled a spondge full of vineger, and put it on a reede, and gaue him to drinke, saying, Let him alone: let vs see if Elias will come, and take him downe.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, and gaue vp the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the vaile of the Temple was rent in twaine, from the toppe to the bottome.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Nowe when the Centurion, which stoode ouer against him, sawe that he thus crying gaue vp the ghost, he saide, Truely this man was the Sonne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>There were also women, which beheld afarre off, among whom was Marie Magdalene, and Marie (the mother of Iames the lesse, and of Ioses) and Salome,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Which also when he was in Galile, folowed him, and ministred vnto him, and many other women which came vp with him vnto Hierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And nowe when the night was come (because it was the day of the preparation that is before the Sabbath)  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Ioseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellour, which also looked for the kingdome of God, came, and went in boldly vnto Pilate, and asked the body of Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Pilate marueiled, if he were already dead, and called vnto him the Centurion, and asked of him whether he had bene any while dead.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And when he knewe the trueth of the Centurion, he gaue the body to Ioseph:  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Who bought a linnen cloth, and tooke him downe, and wrapped him in the linnen cloth, and laide him in a tombe that was hewen out of a rocke, and rolled a stone vnto the doore of the sepulchre:  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And Marie Magdalene, and Marie Ioses mother, behelde where he should be layed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
