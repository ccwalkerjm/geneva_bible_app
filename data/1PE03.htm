Yea, feare not their feare, neither be troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready alwayes to giue an answere to euery man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekenesse and reuerence,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Hauing a good coscience, that whe they speake euill of you as of euill doers, they may be ashamed, which slander your good conuersation in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For it is better (if the will of God be so) that ye suffer for well doing, then for euil doing.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For Christ also hath once suffered for sinnes, the iust for the vniust, that he might bring vs to God, and was put to death concerning the flesh, but was quickened by the spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>By the which hee also went, and preached vnto the spirits that are in prison.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Which were in time passed disobedient, when once the long suffering of God abode in the dayes of Noe, while the Arke was preparing, wherein fewe, that is, eight soules were saued in the water.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Whereof the baptisme that nowe is, answering that figure, (which is not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but a confident demaunding which a good conscience maketh to God) saueth vs also by the resurrection of Iesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Which is at the right hand of God, gone into heauen, to whom the Angels, and Powers, and might are subiect. </div><ul class='tnav'>
