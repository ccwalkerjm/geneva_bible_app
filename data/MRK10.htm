Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steale. Thou shalt not beare false witnesse. Thou shalt hurt no man. Honour thy father and mother.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then he answered, and said to him, Master, all these things I haue obserued from my youth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Iesus looked vpon him, and loued him, and sayde vnto him, One thing is lacking vnto thee. Go and sell all that thou hast, and giue to the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come, follow me, and take vp the crosse.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But hee was sad at that saying, and went away sorowfull: for he had great possessions.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Iesus looked round about, and sayd vnto his disciples, Howe hardly doe they that haue riches, enter into the kingdome of God!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And his disciples were afraide at his words. But Iesus answered againe, and sayd vnto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdome of God!  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>It is easier for a camel to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they were much more astonied, saying with themselues, Who then can be saued?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Iesus looked vpon them, and sayd, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Peter began to say vnto him, Loe, we haue forsaken all, and haue folowed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Iesus answered, and sayd, Verely I say vnto you, there is no man that hath forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my sake and the Gospels,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But he shall receiue an hundred folde, now at this present, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands with persecutions, and in the world to come, eternall life.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But many that are first, shall be last, and the last, first.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they were in the way going vp to Hierusalem, and Iesus went before them and they were troubled, and as they followed, they were afraide, and Iesus tooke the twelue againe, and began to tell them what things should come vnto him,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Saying, Beholde, we goe vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall be deliuered vnto the hie Priests, and to the Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death, and shall deliuer him to the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they shall mocke him, and scourge him, and spit vpon him, and kill him: but the third day he shall rise againe.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Iames and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedeus came vnto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest doe for vs that we desire.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he sayd vnto them, What would ye I should doe for you?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they said to him, Graunt vnto vs, that we may sit, one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy glory.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But Iesus sayd vnto them, Ye knowe not what ye aske. Can ye drinke of the cup that I shall drinke of, and be baptized with the baptisme that I shall be baptized with?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they said vnto him, We can. But Iesus sayd vnto them, Ye shall drinke in deede of the cup that I shall drinke of, and be baptized with the baptisme wherewith I shalbe baptized:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But to sit at my right hand, and at my left, is not mine to giue, but it shalbe giuen to them for whome it is prepared.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when the ten heard that, they began to disdaine at Iames and Iohn.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But Iesus called them vnto him, and sayd to them, Ye know that they which are princes among the Gentiles, haue domination ouer them, and they that be great among them, exercise authoritie ouer them.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, shall be your seruant.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And whosoeuer will be chiefe of you, shall be the seruant of all.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For euen the Sonne of man came not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the raunsome of many.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then they came to Iericho: and as he went out of Iericho with his disciples, and a great multitude, Bartimeus the sonne of Timeus, a blinde man, sate by the wayes side, begging.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And when hee heard that it was Iesus of Nazareth, he began to crye, and to say, Iesus the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And many rebuked him, because he should holde his peace: but hee cryed much more, O Sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Then Iesus stood still, and commanded him to be called: and they called the blind, saying vnto him, Be of good comfort: arise, he calleth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>So he threwe away his cloke, and rose, and came to Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And Iesus answered, and said vnto him, What wilt thou that I doe vnto thee? And the blinde sayd vnto him, Lord, that I may receiue sight.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then Iesus sayde vnto him, Goe thy way: thy fayth hath saued thee. And by and by, he receiued his sight, and folowed Iesus in the way. </div><ul class='tnav'>
