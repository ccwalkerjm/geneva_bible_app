Abhorre that which is euill, and cleaue vnto that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Be affectioned to loue one another with brotherly loue. In giuing honour, goe one before another,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Not slouthfull to do seruice: seruent in spirit seruing the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Reioycing in hope, pacient in tribulation, continuing in prayer,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Distributing vnto the necessities of the Saintes: giuing your selues to hospitalitie.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Blesse them which persecute you: blesse, I say, and curse not.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Be of like affection one towardes another: be not hie minded: but make your selues equall to them of the lower sort: be not wise in your selues.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Recompence to no man euill for euill: procure things honest in the sight of all men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If it bee possible, as much as in you is, haue peace with all men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Dearely beloued, auenge not your selues, but giue place vnto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine: I will repay, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore, if thine enemie hunger, feede him: if he thirst, giue him drinke: for in so doing, thou shalt heape coales of fire on his head.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Bee not ouercome of euill, but ouercome euill with goodnesse. </div><ul class='tnav'>
