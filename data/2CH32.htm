Then the people were confirmed by the wordes of Hezekiah King of Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>After this, did Saneherib King of Asshur send his seruants to Ierusalem (while he was against Lachish, and all his dominion with him) vnto Hezekiah King of Iudah and vnto all Iudah that were at Ierusalem, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus saith Saneherib the King of Asshur, Wherein doe ye trust, that ye will remaine in Ierusalem, during the siege?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Doeth not Hezekiah entice you to giue ouer your selues vnto death by famine and by thirst, saying, The Lord our God shall deliuer vs out of the hande of the King of Asshur?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his hie places and his altars, and commanded Iudah and Ierusalem, saying, Ye shall worshippe before one altar, and burne incense vpon it?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Knowe ye not what I and my fathers haue done vnto all the people of other countreyes? were the gods of the nations of other landes able to deliuer their land out of mine hande?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Who is he of al the gods of those natios (that my fathers haue destroied) that could deliuer his people out of mine hande? that your God should be able to deliuer you out of mine hand?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nowe therefore let not Hezekiah deceiue you, nor seduce you after this sort, neither beleeue ye him: for none of all the gods of any nation or kingdome was able to deliuer his people out of mine hande and out of the hande of my fathers: howe much lesse shall your gods deliuer you out of mine hande?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And his seruants spake yet more against the Lord God, and against his seruant Hezekiah.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He wrote also letters, blaspheming the Lord God of Israel and speaking against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other countreies could not deliuer their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliuer his people out of mine hande.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then they cryed with a loude voyce in the Iewes speach vnto the people of Ierusalem that were on the wall, to feare them and to astonish them, that they might take the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thus they spake against the God of Ierusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, euen the workes of mans hands,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But Hezekiah the King, and the Prophet Isaiah the sonne of Amoz prayed against this and cryed to heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord sent an Angel which destroyed all the valiant men, and the princes and captaines of the hoste of the King of Asshur: so he returned with shame to his owne lande. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came foorth of his owne bowels, slewe him there with the sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the Lord saued Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem from the hande of Saneherib King of Asshur, and from the hande of all other, and maintained them on euery side.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And many brought offrings vnto the Lord to Ierusalem, and presents to Hezekiah King of Iudah, so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thencefoorth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>In those dayes Hezekiah was sicke vnto the death, and prayed vnto the Lord, who spake vnto him, and gaue him a signe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Hezekiah did not render according to the rewarde bestowed vpon him: for his heart was lift vp, and wrath came vpon him, and vpon Iudah and Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled him selfe (after that his heart was lifted vp) he and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and the wrath of the Lord came not vpon them in the dayes of Hezekiah.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Hezekiah also had exceeding much riches and honour, and he gate him treasures of siluer, and of golde, and of precious stones, and of sweete odours, and of shieldes, and of all pleasant vessels:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And of store houses for the increase of wheat and wine and oyle, and stalles for all beasts, and rowes for the stables.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he made him cities, and had possession of sheepe and oxen in abundance: for God had giuen him substance exceeding much.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>This same Hezekiah also stopped the vpper water springs of Gihon, and led them streight vnderneath towarde the citie of Dauid Westwarde. so Hezekiah prospered in all his workes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But because of the ambassadours of the princes of Babel, which sent vnto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the lande, God left him to trie him, and to knowe all that was in his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Concerning the rest of the actes of Hezekiah, and his goodnesse, beholde, they are written in the vision of Ishiah the Prophet, the sonne of Amoz, in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in the highest sepulchre of the sonnes of Dauid: and all Iudah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem did him honour at his death: and Manasseh his sonne reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
