Save mee, O God: for the waters are entred euen to my soule.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I sticke fast in the deepe myre, where no staie is: I am come into deepe waters, and the streames runne ouer me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I am wearie of crying: my throte is drie: mine eyes faile, whiles I waite for my God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They that hate mee without a cause, are moe then the heares of mine heade: they that would destroy mee, and are mine enemies falsly, are mightie, so that I restored that which I tooke not.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>O God, thou knowest my foolishnesse, and my fautes are not hid from thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hostes, be ashamed for me: let not those that seeke thee, be confounded through mee, O God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For thy sake haue I suffred reproofe: shame hath couered my face.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I am become a stranger vnto my brethren, euen an aliant vnto my mothers sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the zeale of thine house hath eaten mee, and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee, are fallen vpon me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I wept and my soule fasted, but that was to my reproofe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I put on a sacke also: and I became a prouerbe vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They that sate in the gate, spake of mee, and the drunkards sang of me.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But Lord, I make my praier vnto thee in an acceptable time, euen in the multitude of thy mercie: O God, heare me in the trueth of thy saluation.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Deliuer mee out of the myre, that I sinke not: let me be deliuered from them that hate me, and out of the deepe waters.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let not the water flood drowne mee, neither let the deepe swallowe me vp: and let not the pit shut her mouth vpon me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Heare me, O Lord, for thy louing kindnes is good: turne vnto me according to ye multitude of thy tender mercies.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And hide not thy face from thy seruant, for I am in trouble: make haste and heare me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Draw neere vnto my soule and redeeme it: deliuer me because of mine enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou hast knowen my reproofe and my shame, and my dishonour: all mine aduersaries are before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Rebuke hath broken mine heart, and I am full of heauinesse, and I looked for some to haue pitie on me, but there was none: and for comforters, but I found none.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For they gaue me gall in my meate, and in my thirst they gaue me vineger to drinke.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let their table be a snare before them, and their prosperitie their ruine.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Let their eyes be blinded that they see not: and make their loynes alway to tremble.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Powre out thine anger vpon them, and let thy wrathfull displeasure take them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Let their habitation be voide, and let none dwell in their tents.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For they persecute him, whome thou hast smitten: and they adde vnto the sorrowe of them, whome thou hast wounded.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Laie iniquitie vpon their iniquitie, and let them not come into thy righteousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Let them be put out of the booke of life, neither let them be written with the righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When I am poore and in heauinesse, thine helpe, O God, shall exalt me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will praise the Name of God with a song, and magnifie him with thankesgiuing.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>This also shall please the Lord better then a yong bullocke, that hath hornes and hoofes.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The humble shall see this, and they that seeke God, shalbe glad, and your heart shall liue.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For the Lord heareth the poore, and despiseth not his prisoners.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let heauen and earth praise him: the seas and all that moueth in them.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For God will saue Zion, and builde the cities of Iudah, that men may dwell there and haue it in possession.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The seede also of his seruants shall inherit it: and they that loue his name, shall dwel therein. </div><ul class='tnav'>
