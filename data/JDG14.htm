And Samson sayd vnto his father, Giue mee her, for she pleaseth me well.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But his father and his mother knewe not that it came of the Lord, that he should seeke an occasion against the Philistims: for at that time the Philistims reigned ouer Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then went Samson and his father and his mother downe to Timnath, and came to ye vineyardes at Timnath: and beholde, a young Lyon roared vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Spirit of the Lord came vpon him, and he tare him, as one should haue rent a kid, and had nothing in his hand, neither told he his father nor his mother what he had done.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he went down, and talked with the woman which was beautifull in the eyes of Samson.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And within a fewe dayes, when he returned to receiue her, he went aside to see the karkeis of the Lion: and behold, there was a swarme of bees, and hony in the body of the Lyon.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he tooke therof in his handes, and went eating, and came to his father and to his mother, and gaue vnto them, and they did eate: but hee told not them, that he had taken the hony out of the body of the lyon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So his father went down vnto the woman, and Samson made there a feast: for so vsed the yong men to doe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when they sawe him, they brought thirtie companions to be with him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Samson sayd vnto them, I will nowe put forth a riddle vnto you: and if you can declare it me within seuen dayes of the feast, and finde it out, I will giue you thirty sheetes, and thirtie change of garments.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But if you cannot declare it mee, then shall yee giue mee thirty sheetes and thirtie change of garments. And they answered him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may heare it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he sayd vnto them, Out of the eater came meate, and out of the strong came sweetenesse: and they could not in three dayes expound the riddle.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when the seuenth day was come, they said vnto Samsons wife, Entise thine husband, that he may declare vs the riddle, lest wee burne thee and thy fathers house with fire. Haue ye called vs, to possesse vs? is it not so?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Samsons wife wept before him, and said, Surely thou hatest mee and louest mee not: for thou hast put forth a riddle vnto the children of my people, and hast not told it mee. And hee sayd vnto her, Beholde, I haue not told it my father, nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Samsons wife wept before him seuen dayes, while their feast lasted: and when the seuenth day came he tolde her, because she was importunate vpon him: so she told the riddle to the children of her people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the men of ye citie sayde vnto him the seuenth day before the Sunne went downe, What is sweeter then honie? and what is stronger then a lyon? Then sayd hee vnto them, If yee had not plowed with my heiffer, yee had not found out my riddle.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Spirite of the Lord came vpon him, and he went downe to Ashkelon, and slew thirtie men of them and spoyled them, and gaue chaunge of garments vnto them, which expounded the riddle: and his wrath was kindled, and he went vp to his fathers house.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Samsons wife was giuen to his companion, whom he had vsed as his friend. </div><ul class='tnav'>
