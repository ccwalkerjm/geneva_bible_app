And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then thou shalt say, They be thy seruant Iaakobs: it is a present sent vnto my lord Esau: and beholde, he him selfe also is behinde vs.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So likewise commanded he the seconde and the thirde, and all that followed the droues, saying, After this maner, ye shall speake vnto Esau, when ye finde him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And ye shall say moreouer, Beholde, thy seruant Iaakob commeth after vs (for he thought, I will appease his wrath with the present that goeth before me, and afterwarde I will see his face: it may be that he will accept me.)  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So went the present before him: but he taried that night with the companie.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he rose vp the same night, and tooke his two wiues, and his two maides, and his eleuen children, and went ouer the forde Iabbok.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he tooke them, and sent them ouer the riuer, and sent ouer that he had.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now when Iaakob was left him selfe alone, there wrestled a man with him vnto the breaking of the day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he sawe that he could not preuaile against him: therefore he touched the holowe of his thigh, and the holowe of Iaakobs thigh was loosed, as he wrestled with him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he saide, Let me goe, for the morning appeareth. Who answered, I will not let thee go except thou blesse me.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then said he vnto him, What is thy name? And he said, Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then said he, Thy name shalbe called Iaakob no more, but Israel: because thou hast had power with God, thou shalt also preuaile with men.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Iaakob demaded, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore now doest thou aske my name? and he blessed him there  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Iaakob called the name of the place, Peniel: for, saide he, I haue seene God face to face, and my life is preserued.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the sunne rose vp to him as he passed Peniel, and he halted vpon his thigh.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore the children of Israel eate not of the sinewe that shranke in the hollowe of the thigh, vnto this day: because he touched the sinew that shranke in the holow of Iaakobs thigh. </div><ul class='tnav'>
