Then I knewe that this was the worde of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I bought the field of Hanameel, mine vncles sonne, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the siluer, euen seuen shekels, and tenne pieces of siluer.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I writ it in the booke and signed it, and tooke witnesses, and weighed him the siluer in the balances.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So I tooke the booke of the possession, being sealed according to the Lawe, and custome, with the booke that was open,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I gaue the booke of the possession vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, the sonne of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine vncles sonne, and in the presence of the witnesses, written in the booke of the possession, before al the Iewes that sate in the court of the prison.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Take the writings, euen this booke of the possession, both that is sealed, and this booke that is open, and put them in an earthen vessell, that they may continue a long time.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel saith thus, Houses and fieldes, and vineyardes shall be possessed againe in this land.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Now when I had deliuered the booke of the possession vnto Baruch, the sonne of Neriah, I prayed vnto the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Ah Lord God, beholde, thou hast made the heauen and the earth by thy great power, and by thy stretched out arme, and there is nothing hard vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou shewest mercie vnto thousands, and recompensest the iniquitie of the fathers into the bosome of their children after them: O God the great and mightie, whose Name is ye Lord of hostes,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Great in counsell, and mightie in worke, (for thine eyes are open vpon all the wayes of ye sonnes of men, to giue to euery one according to his wayes, and according to the fruite of his workes)  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Which hast set signes and wonders in the land of Egypt vnto this day, and in Israel, and among all men, and hast made thee a Name, as appeareth this day,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And hast brought thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signes, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, with a stretched out arme, and with great terrour,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And hast giuen them this land, which thou diddest sweare to their fathers to giue them, euen a land, that floweth with milke and hony,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voyce, neither walked in thy Law: all that thou commaundedst them to doe, they haue not done: therefore thou hast caused this whole plague to come vpon them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Beholde, the mounts, they are come into the citie to take it, and the citie is giuen into the hande of the Caldeans, that fight against it by meanes of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence, and what thou hast spoken, is come to passe, and beholde, thou seest it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And thou hast sayd vnto me, O Lord God, Bye vnto thee the fielde for siluer, and take witnesses: for the citie shall be giuen into the hand of the Caldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then came the worde of the Lord vnto Ieremiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Beholde, I am the LORD GOD of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord, Beholde, I wil giue this citie into the hand of the Caldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchad-nezzar, King of Babel, and he shall take it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the Caldeans shall come and fight against this citie, and set fire on this citie and burne it, with the houses, vpon whose rouses they haue offred incense vnto Baal, and powred drinke offrings vnto other gods, to prouoke me vnto anger.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For the children of Israel, and the children of Iudah haue surely done euill before me from their youth: for the children of Israel haue surely prouoked me to anger with the workes of their hands, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore this citie hath bene vnto me as a prouocation of mine anger, and of my wrath, from the day, that they built it, euen vnto this day, that I should remoue it out of my sight,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Because of all the euill of the children of Israel, and of the children of Iudah, which they haue done to prouoke mee to anger, euen they, their Kings, their Princes, their Priests, and their Prophets, and the men of Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they haue turned vnto me the backe and not the face: though I taught them rising vp earely, and instructing them, yet they were not obedient to receiue doctrine,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But they set their abominations in ye house (whereupon my Name was called) to defile it,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they built the hie places of Baal, which are in the valley of Ben-hinnom, to cause their sonnes and their daughters to passe through the fire vnto Molech, which I commanded them not, neither came it into my minde, that they should doe such abomination, to cause Iudah to sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And nowe therefore, thus hath the Lord God of Israel spoken, concerning this citie, whereof ye say, It shalbe deliuered into the hand of the King of Babel by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Beholde, I will gather them out of all countreys, wherein I haue scattered them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation, and I wil bring them againe vnto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And I wil giue them one heart and one way that they may feare me for euer for ye wealth of them, and of their children after them.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And I wil make an euerlasting couenant with them, that I wil neuer turne away from them to doe them good, but I wil put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Yea, I wil delite in them to do them good, and I wil plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart, and with all my soule.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>For thus sayth the Lord, Like as I haue brought all this great plague vpon this people, so wil I bring vpon them all the good that I haue promised them.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And the fields shalbe possessed in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast, and shalbe giuen into the hand of the Caldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Men shall buy fields for siluer, and make writings and seale them, and take witnesses in the land of Beniamin, and round about Ierusalem, and in the cities of Iudah, and in the cities of the mountaines, and in the cities of the plaine, and in the cities of the South: for I wil cause their captiuitie to returne, saith the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
