Then I sayd, Here am I, send me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he sayd, Goe, and say vnto this people, Ye shall heare in deede, but ye shall not vnderstand: ye shall plainely see, and not perceiue.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Make the heart of this people fatte, make their eares heauie, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and vnderstand with their hearts, and conuert, and he heale them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then sayd I, Lord, howe long? And he answered, Vntill the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be vtterly desolate,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord haue remoued men farre away, and there be a great desolation in the mids of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But yet in it shalbe a tenth, and shall returne, and shalbe eaten vp as an elme or an oke, which haue a substance in them, when they cast their leaues: so the holy seede shall be the substance thereof. </div><ul class='tnav'>
