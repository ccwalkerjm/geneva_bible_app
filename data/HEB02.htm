And in that he hath put all things in subiection vnder him, he left nothing that should not be subiect vnto him. But we yet see not all things subdued vnto him,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But we see Iesus crowned with glory and honour, which was made litle inferiour to the Angels, through the suffering of death, that by Gods grace he might taste death for all men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For it became him, for whome are all these thinges, and by whome are all these things, seeing that hee brought many children vnto glory, that he should consecrate the Prince of their saluation through afflictions.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he that sanctifieth, and they which are sanctified, are all of one: wherefore he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Saying, I will declare thy Name vnto my brethren: in the middes of the Church will I sing praises to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And againe, I will put my trust in him. And againe, Beholde, here am I, and the children which God hath giuen me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himselfe likewise tooke part with them, that hee might destroye through death, him that had the power of death, that is the deuil,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And that he might deliuer all them, which for feare of death were all their life time subiect to bondage.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For he in no sort tooke on him the Angels nature, but hee tooke on him the seede of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Wherefore in all things it behoued him to be made like vnto his brethren, that hee might be mercifull, and a faithfull hie Priest in things concerning God, that he might make reconciliation for the sinnes of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For in that he suffered, and was tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. </div><ul class='tnav'>
