<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 33</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Nowe this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The Lord came from Sinai, and rose vp from Seir vnto them, and appeared clearely from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of Saints, and at his right hand a firie Lawe for them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Though hee loue the people, yet all thy Saints are in thine handes: and they are humbled at thy foete, to receiue thy words.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Moses commanded vs a Lawe for an inheritance of the Congregation of Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then he was among the righteous people, as King, when the heades of the people, and the tribes of Israel were assembled.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let Reuben liue, and not die, though his men be a small nomber.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thus he blessed Iudah, and said, Heare, O Lord, the voyce of Iudah, and bring him vnto his people: his hands shalbe sufficient for him, if thou helpe him against his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And of Leui he said, Let thy Thummim and thine Vrim be with thine Holy one, whome thou diddest proue in Massah, and didst cause him to striue at the waters of Meribah.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Who said vnto his father and to his mother, I haue not seene him, neither knewe he his brethren, nor knewe his owne children: for they obserued thy word, and kept thy couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They shall teach Iaakob thy iudgements, and Israel thy Lawe: they shall put incense before thy face, and the burnt offring vpon thine altar.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Blesse, O Lord, his substance, and accept the worke of his handes: smite through ye loynes of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not againe.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Of Beniamin he said, The beloued of the Lord shall dwell in safetie by him: the Lord shall couer him all the day long, and dwell betweene his shoulders.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And of Ioseph hee sayde, Blessed of the Lord is his land for the sweetenesse of heauen, for the dewe, and for the depth lying beneath,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And for the sweete increase of the sunne, and for the sweete increase of the moone,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And for the sweetenes of the top of the ancient mountaines, and for the sweetenes of the olde hilles,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And for the sweetenesse of the earth, and abundance thereof: and the good will of him that dwelt in the bushe, shall come vpon the head of Ioseph, and vpon the toppe of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>His beautie shalbe like his first borne bullock, and his hornes as the hornes of an vnicorne: with them hee shall smite the people together, euen the endes of the world: these are also the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And of Zebulun he sayd, Reioice, Zebulun, in thy going out, and thou Isshachar in thy tents.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They shall call ye people vnto the mountaine: there they shall offer the sacrifices of righteousnesse: for they shall sucke of the abundance of the sea, and of the treasures hid in the sand.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Also of Gad he said, Blessed be hee that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, that catcheth for his praye the arme with the head.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And hee looked to himselfe at the beginning, because there was a portion of the Lawe-giuer hid: yet hee shall come with the heades of the people, to execute the iustice of the Lord, and his iudgements with Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And of Dan he said, Dan is a lions whelp: he shall leape from Bashan.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Also of Naphtali he sayd, O Naphtali, satisfied with fauour, and filled with the blessing of the Lord, possesse the West and the South.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And of Asher he saide, Asher shalbe blessed with children: he shalbe acceptable vnto his brethren, and shall dippe his foote in oyle.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thy shooes shalbe yron and brasse, and thy strength shall continue as long as thou liuest.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There is none like God, O righteous people, which rideth vpon the heauens for thine helpe, and on the cloudes in his glory.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The eternall God is thy refuge, and vnder his armes thou art for euer: hee shall cast out the enemie before thee, and will say, Destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Israel the fountaine of Iaakob shall dwell alone in safetie in a lande of wheat, and wine: also his heauens shall drop the dewe.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Blessed art thou, O Israel: who is like vnto thee, O people saued by the Lord, the shielde of thine helpe, and which is the sword of thy glorie? therefore thine enemies shall bee in subiection to thee, and thou shalt tread vpon their hie places. </div><ul class='tnav'>
