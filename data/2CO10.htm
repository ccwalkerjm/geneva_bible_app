If any man trust in himselfe that hee is Christes, let him consider this againe of himself, that as he is Christes, euen so are we Christes.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For though I shoulde boast somewhat more of our authoritie, which the Lord hath giuen vs for edification, and not for your destruction, I should haue no shame.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This I say, that I may not seeme as it were to feare you with letters.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the letters, sayeth hee, are sore and strong, but his bodily presence is weake, and his speache is of no value.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let such one thinke this, that such as wee are in woorde by letters, when we are absent, such wil we be also in deede, when we are present.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For wee dare not make our selues of the nomber, or to compare our selues to them, which praise themselues: but they vnderstand not that they measure themselues with themselues, and compare themselues with themselues.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But we wil not reioyce of things, which are not within our measure, but according to the measure of the line, whereof God hath distributed vnto vs a measure to attaine euen vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we stretche not our selues beyonde our measure, as though wee had not attained vnto you: for euen to you also haue we come in preaching the Gospel of Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Not boasting of things which are without our measure: that is, of other mens labours: and we hope, when your faith shall increase, to bee magnified by you according to our line aboundantly,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And to preache the Gospel in those regions which are beyonde you: not to reioyce in another mans line, that is, in the thinges that are prepared alreadie.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But let him that reioyceth, reioyce in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For hee that praiseth himselfe, is not alowed, but he whome the Lord praiseth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
