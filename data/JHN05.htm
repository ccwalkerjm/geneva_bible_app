 <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The sicke man answered him, Sir, I haue no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the poole: but while I am comming, another steppeth downe before me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Iesus said vnto him, Rise: take vp thy bed, and walke.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And immediatly the man was made whole, and tooke vp his bed, and walked: and the same day was the Sabbath.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Iewes therefore said to him that was made whole, It is the Sabbath day: it is not lawfull for thee to cary thy bed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He answered them, He that made me whole, he said vnto me, Take vp thy bed, and walke.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then asked they him, What man is that which said vnto thee, Take vp thy bed and walke?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he that was healed, knewe not who it was: for Iesus had conueied himselfe away from the multitude that was in that place.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And after that, Iesus founde him in the Temple, and said vnto him, Beholde, thou art made whole: sinne no more, lest a worse thing come vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The man departed and tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus, which had made him whole.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And therefore the Iewes did persecute Iesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Iesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I worke.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore the Iewes sought the more to kill him: not onely because he had broken the Sabbath: but said also that God was his Father, and made himselfe equall with God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then answered Iesus, and said vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, The Sonne can doe nothing of himselfe, saue that he seeth the Father doe: for whatsoeuer things he doth, the same things doeth the Sonne in like maner.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the Father loueth the Sonne, and sheweth him all things, whatsoeuer he himselfe doeth, and he will shewe him greater workes then these, that ye should marueile.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For likewise as the Father rayseth vp the dead, and quickeneth them, so the Sonne quickeneth whom he will.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the Father iudgeth no man, but hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Because that all men shoulde honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father: he that honoureth not the Sonne, the same honoureth not the Father, which hath sent him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Verely, verely I say vnto you, he that heareth my worde, and beleeueth him that sent me, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but hath passed from death vnto life.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Verely, verely I say vnto you, the houre shall come, and now is, when the dead shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God: and they that heare it, shall liue.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as the Father hath life in himselfe, so likewise hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himselfe,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And hath giuen him power also to execute iudgement, in that he is the Sonne of man.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Marueile not at this: for the houre shall come, in the which all that are in the graues, shall heare his voyce.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they shall come foorth, that haue done good, vnto ye resurrection of life: but they that haue done euil, vnto the resurrection of condemnation.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I can doe nothing of mine owne selfe: as I heare, I iudge: and my iudgement is iust, because I seeke not mine owne will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If I should beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse were not true.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>There is another that beareth witnesse of me, and I know that the witnesse, which he beareth of me, is true.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Ye sent vnto Iohn, and he bare witnesse vnto the trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But I receiue not the record of man: neuerthelesse these things I say, that ye might be saued.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>He was a burning, and a shining candle: and ye would for a season haue reioyced in his light.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But I haue greater witnesse then the witnesse of Iohn: for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finish, the same workes that I doe, beare witnesse of me, that the Father sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the Father himselfe, which hath sent me, beareth witnesse of me. Ye haue not heard his voyce at any time, neither haue ye seene his shape.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And his worde haue you not abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye beleeued not.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Searche the Scriptures: for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which testifie of me.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But ye will not come to me, that ye might haue life.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I receiue not the prayse of men.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But I know you, that ye haue not the loue of God in you.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>I am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receiue me not: if another shall come in his owne name, him will ye receiue.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>How can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of another, and seeke not the honour that commeth of God alone?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Doe not thinke that I will accuse you to my Father: there is one that accuseth you, euen Moses, in whom ye trust.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For had ye beleeued Moses, ye would haue beleeued me: for he wrote of me.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>But if ye beleeue not his writings, how shall ye beleeue my wordes? </div><ul class='tnav'>
