Wherefore all Israel made Omri the captaine of the hoste, king ouer Israel that same day, euen in the hoste.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Omri went vp from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when Zimri saw, that the citie was taken, he went into the palace of the Kings house, and burnt himselfe, and the Kings house with fire, and so dyed,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For his sinnes which hee sinned, in doing that which is euil in the sight of the Lord, in walking in the way of Ieroboam, and in his sinnes which he did, causing Israel to sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the rest of the actes of Zimri, and his treason that hee wrought, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kinges of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then were the people of Israel deuided into two partes: for halfe the people followed Tibni the sonne of Ginath to make him King, and the other halfe followed Omri.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the people that folowed Omri, preuayled against the people that followed Tibni the sonne of Ginath: so Tibni dyed, and Omri reigned.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In the one and thirtie yeere of Asa King of Iudah bega Omri to reigne ouer Israel, and reigned twelue yeere. Sixe yeere reigned he in Tirzah.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he bought the mountaine Samaria of one Shemer for two talents of siluer, and buylt in the mountaine, and called the name of the citie, which he buylt, after the name of Shemer lord of the mountaine, Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Omri did euil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse then all that were before him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For he walked in all the way of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and in his sinnes wherewith he made Israel to sinne in prouoking the Lord God of Israel with their vanities.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the rest of the actes of Omri, that hee did, and his strength that he shewed, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Omri slept with his fathers, and was buryed in Samaria: and Ahab his sonne reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Nowe Ahab the sonne of Omri began to reigne ouer Israel, in the eyght and thirtie yeere of Asa king of Iudah: and Ahab the sonne of Omri reigned ouer Israel in Samaria two and twenty yere.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Ahab the sonne of Omri did worse in ye sight of the Lord then al that were before him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For was it a light thing for him to walke in the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, except hee tooke Iezebel also the daughter of Ethbaal King of the Zidonians to wife, and went and serued Baal, and worshipped him?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Also he reared vp an altar to Baal in the house of Baal, which he had buylt in Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Ahab made a groue, and Ahab proceeded, and did prouoke the Lord God of Israel more then all the kings of Israel that were before him.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>In his dayes did Hiel the Bethelite buylde Iericho: he layed the foundation thereof in Abiram his eldest sonne, and set vp the gates thereof in his yongest sonne Segub, according to the worde of the Lord which he spake by Ioshua the sonne of Nun. </div><ul class='tnav'>
