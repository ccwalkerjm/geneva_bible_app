Then shall he say, I can not: for it is sealed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the booke is giuen vnto him that can not reade, saying, Reade this, I pray thee. And he shall say, I can not reade.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord sayd, Because this people come neere vnto me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but haue remooued their heart farre from me, and their feare toward me was taught by the precept of men,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore behold, I wil againe doe a marueilous worke in this people, euen a marueilous worke, and a wonder: for the wisdome of their wise men shall perish, and the vnderstanding of their prudent men shalbe hid.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Wo vnto them that seeke deepe to hide their counsell from the Lord: for their workes are in darkenes, and they say, Who seeth vs? and who knoweth vs?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Your turning of deuises shall it not be esteemed as the potters clay? for shall the worke say of him that made it, Hee made me not? or the thing formed, say of him that facioned it, He had none vnderstanding?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Is it not yet but a litle while, and Lebanon shall be turned into Carmel? and Carmel shall be counted as a forest?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And in that day shall the deafe heare the wordes of the booke, and the eyes of the blinde shall see out of obscuritie, and out of darkenesse.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The meeke in the Lord shall receiue ioye againe, and the poore men shall reioyce in the holy one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the cruel man shall cease, and the scornefull shalbe consumed: and all that hasted to iniquitie, shalbe cut off:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Which made a man to sinne in ye worde, and tooke him in a snare: which reproued them in the gate, and made the iust to fall without cause.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore thus sayth the Lord vnto the house of Iaakob, euen hee that redeemed Abraham, Iaakob shall not now be confounded, neither now shall his face be pale.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But when he seeth his children, the worke of mine hands, in the mids of him, they shall sanctifie my Name, and sanctifie the holy one of Iaakob, and shall feare the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then they that erred in spirit, shall haue vnderstanding, and they that murmured, shall learne doctrine. </div><ul class='tnav'>
