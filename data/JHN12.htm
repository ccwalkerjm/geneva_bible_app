<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Iesus, sixe dayes before the Passeouer, came to Bethania, where Lazarus was, who died, whom he had raised from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>There they made him a supper, and Martha serued: but Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then tooke Mary a pound of oyntment of Spikenarde very costly, and anoynted Iesus feete, and wiped his feete with her heare, and the house was filled with the sauour of the oyntment.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then said one of his disciples, euen Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne, which should betray him:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Why was not this oyntment sold for three hundreth pence, and giuen to the poore?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Nowe he said this, not that he cared for the poore, but because hee was a theefe, and had the bagge, and bare that which was giuen.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then said Iesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying she kept it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the poore alwayes yee haue with you, but me ye shall not haue alwayes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then much people of the Iewes knewe that hee was there: and they came, not for Iesus sake onely, but that they might see Lazarus also, whome he had raysed from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The hie Priestes therefore consulted, that they might put Lazarus to death also,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because that for his sake many of the Iewes went away, and beleeued in Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>On the morowe a great multitude that were come to the feast, when they heard that Iesus should come to Hierusalem,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Tooke branches of palme trees, and went foorth to meete him, and cried, Hosanna, Blessed is the King of Israel that commeth in the Name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Iesus found a yong asse, and sate thereon, as it is written,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Feare not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King commeth sitting on an asses colte.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But his disciples vnderstoode not these thinges at the first: but when Iesus was glorified, then remembred they, that these thinges were written of him, and that they had done these things vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The people therefore that was with him, bare witnesse that hee called Lazarus out of the graue, and raised him from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore mette him the people also, because they heard that he had done this miracle.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Pharises said among themselues, Perceiue ye howe ye preuaile nothing? Beholde, the worlde goeth after him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Nowe there were certaine Greekes among them that came vp to worship at the feast.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they came to Philippe, which was of Bethsaida in Galile, and desired him, saying, Syr, we would see that Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Philippe came and tolde Andrew: and againe Andrew and Philippe tolde Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Iesus answered them, saying, The houre is come, that the Sonne of man must bee glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Verely, verely I say vnto you, Except the wheate corne fall into the grounde and die, it bideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth foorth much fruite.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He that loueth his life, shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keepe it vnto life eternall.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If any man serue me, let him follow me: for where I am, there shall also my seruant be: and if any man serue me, him will my Father honour.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Now is my soule troubled: and what shall I say? Father, saue me from this houre: but therefore came I vnto this houre.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Father, glorifie thy Name. Then came there a voyce from heauen, saying, I haue both glorified it, and will glorifie it againe.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then saide the people that stoode by, and heard, that it was a thunder: other said, An Angel spake to him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Iesus answered, and said, This voyce came not because of me, but for your sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now is the iudgement of this world: nowe shall the prince of this world be cast out.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And I, if I were lift vp from the earth, will drawe all men vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Nowe this sayd he, signifying what death he should die.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The people answered him, We haue heard out of the Law, that that Christ bideth for euer: and howe sayest thou, that that Sonne of man must be lift vp? Who is that Sonne of man?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Yet a litle while is the light with you: walke while ye haue that light, lest the darkenes come vpon you: for hee that walketh in the darke, knoweth not whither he goeth.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>While ye haue that light, beleeue in that light, that ye may be the children of the light. These things spake Iesus, and departed, and hid himselfe from them.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And though he had done so many miracles before them, yet beleeued they not on him,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>That the saying of Esaias the Prophete might be fulfilled, that he sayd, Lord, who beleeued our report? and to whome is the arme of the Lord reueiled?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Therefore could they not beleeue, because that Esaias saith againe,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they shoulde not see with their eyes, nor vnderstand with their heart, and should be conuerted, and I should heale them.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>These things sayd Esaias when he sawe his glory, and spake of him.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Neuertheles, euen among the chiefe rulers, many beleeued in him: but because of the Pharises they did not confesse him, least they should be cast out of the Synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>For they loued the prayse of men, more then the prayse of God.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Iesus cryed, and sayd, He that beleeueth in me, beleeueth not in me, but in him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>I am come a light into the world, that whosoeuer beleeueth in me, should not abide in darkenes.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And if any man heare my wordes, and beleeue not, I iudge him not: for I came not to iudge the world, but to saue the world.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He that refuseth me, and receiueth not my wordes, hath one that iudgeth him: the worde that I haue spoken, it shall iudge him in the last day.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>For I haue not spoken of my selfe: but the Father which sent me, hee gaue me a commandement what I should say, and what I should speake.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And I knowe that his commandement is life euerlasting: the thinges therefore that I speake, I speake them so as the Father sayde vnto me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
