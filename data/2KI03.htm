<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Nowe Iehoram the sonne of Ahab beganne to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, the eighteenth yeere of Iehoshaphat King of Iudah, and reigned twelue yeeres.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he wrought euill in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father nor like his mother: for he tooke away the image of Baal that his father had made.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, he cleaued vnto the sinnes of Ieroboam, the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne, and departed not therefrom.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then Mesha King of Moab had store of sheepe, and rendred vnto the King of Israel an hundreth thousande lambes, and an hundreth thousande rammes with the wooll.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the King of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore King Iehoram went out of Samaria the same season, and nombred all Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And went, and sent to Iehoshaphat King of Iudah, saying, The King of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou goe with me to battell against Moab? And he answered, I will goe vp: for I am, as thou art, my people, as thy people, and mine horses as thine horses.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then said he, What way shall we goe vp? And he answered, The way of the wildernesse of Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So went the King of Israel and the king of Iudah, and the King of Edom, and when they had compassed the way seuen dayes, they had no water for the hoste, nor for the cattell that followed them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore the King of Israel sayde, Alas, that the Lord hath called these three Kings, to giue them into the hand of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Iehoshaphat saide, Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him? And one of the King of Israels seruants answered, and said, Here is Elisha the sonne of Shaphat, which powred water on the handes of Eliiah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Iehoshaphat saide, The worde of the Lord is with him. Therefore the King of Israel, and Iehoshaphat, and the King of Edom went downe to him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Elisha sayde vnto the King of Israel, What haue I to doe with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother. And the King of Israel saide vnto him, Nay: for the Lord hath called these three Kings, to giue them into the hande of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Elisha said, As the Lord of hostes liueth, in whose sight I stande, if it were not, that I regarde the presence of Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah, I woulde not haue looked towarde thee, nor seene thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But nowe bring me a minstrel. And when the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord came vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he saide, Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord, Ye shall neither see winde nor see raine, yet the valley shalbe filled with water, that ye may drinke, both ye and your cattel, and your beastes.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But this is a small thing in the sight of the Lord: for he will giue Moab into your hande.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And ye shall smite euery strong towne and euery chiefe citie, and shall fell euery faire tree, and shall stoppe all the fountaines of water, and marre euery good fielde with stones.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And in the morning whe the meat offring was offred, beholde, there came water by the way of Edom: and the countrey was filled with water.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when al the Moabites heard that the Kings were come vp to fight against them, they gathered all that was able to put on harnesse, and vpwarde, and stood in their border.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they rose earely in the morning, when the sunne arose vpon the water, and the Moabites saw the water ouer against them, as red as blood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they saide, This is blood the Kings are surely slaine, and one hath smitten another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoyle.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when they came to the host of Israel, the Israelites arose vp, and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them, but they inuaded them, and smote Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they destroyed the cities: and on all the good field euery man cast his stone, and filled them and they stopt all the fountaines of water, and felled all the good trees: onely in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof: howebeit they went about it with slings, and smote it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when the King of Moab saw that the battel was too sore for him, he tooke with him seuen hudreth men that drew the sword, to break through vnto the King of Edom: but they could not.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then he tooke his eldest sonne, that should haue reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offring vpon the wall: so that Israel was sore grieued, and they departed from him, and returned to their countrey. </div><ul class='tnav'>
