I pray thee goe in vnto my maide: it may be that I shall receiue a childe by her. And Abram obeyed the voyce of Sarai.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Sarai Abrams wife tooke Hagar her maide the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelled ten yeere in the land of Canaan, and gaue her to her husband Abram for his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he went in vnto Hagar, and she conceiued. and when she sawe that she had conceiued, her dame was despised in her eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Sarai saide to Abram, Thou doest me wrong. I haue giuen my maide into thy bosome, and she seeth that she hath conceiued, and I am despised in her eyes: the Lord iudge betweene me and thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Abram saide to Sarai, Beholde, thy maide is in thine hand: doe with her as it pleaseth thee.
