I will sing the mercies of the Lord for euer: with my mouth will I declare thy trueth from generation to generation.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For I said, Mercie shalbe set vp for euer: thy trueth shalt thou stablish in ye very heauens.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I haue made a couenant with my chosen: I haue sworne to Dauid my seruant,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Thy seede will I stablish for euer, and set vp thy throne from generation to generation. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>O Lord, euen the heauens shall prayse thy wonderous worke: yea, thy trueth in the Congregation of the Saints.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For who is equall to the Lord in the heauen? and who is like the Lord among the sonnes of the gods?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>God is very terrible in the assemblie of the Saints, and to be reuerenced aboue all, that are about him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>O Lord God of hostes, who is like vnto thee, which art a mightie Lord, and thy trueth is about thee?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waues thereof arise, thou stillest them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou hast beaten downe Rahab as a man slaine: thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy mightie arme.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The heauens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast layde the foundation of the world, and all that therein is.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou hast created the North and the South: Tabor and Hermon shall reioyce in thy Name.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou hast a mightie arme: strong is thine hand, and high is thy right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Righteousnesse and equitie are the stablishment of thy throne: mercy and trueth goe before thy face.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Blessed is the people, that can reioyce in thee: they shall walke in the light of thy countenance, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They shall reioyce continually in thy Name, and in thy righteousnes shall they exalt them selues.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thou art the glory of their strength, and by thy fauour our hornes shall be exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For our shield apperteineth to the Lord, and our King to the holy one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou spakest then in a vision vnto thine Holy one, and saydest, I haue layde helpe vpon one that is mightie: I haue exalted one chosen out of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I haue found Dauid my seruant: with mine holy oyle haue I anoynted him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore mine hande shall be established with him, and mine arme shall strengthen him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The enemie shall not oppresse him, neither shall the wicked hurt him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But I will destroy his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>My trueth also and my mercie shall be with him, and in my Name shall his horne be exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the floods.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He shall cry vnto mee, Thou art my Father, my God and the rocke of my saluation.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Also I wil make him my first borne, higher then the Kings of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>My mercie will I keepe for him for euermore, and my couenant shall stande fast with him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>His seede also will I make to endure for euer, and his throne as the dayes of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But if his children forsake my Lawe, and walke not in my iudgements:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If they breake my statutes, and keepe not my commandements:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then will I visite their transgression with the rod, and their iniquitie with strokes.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Yet my louing kindnesse will I not take from him, neither will I falsifie my trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>My couenant wil I not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I haue sworne once by mine holines, that I will not fayle Dauid, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>His seede shall endure for euer, and his throne shalbe as the sunne before me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He shalbe established for euermore as the moone, and as a faythfull witnes in the heauen. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But thou hast reiected and abhorred, thou hast bene angry with thine Anoynted.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Thou hast broken the couenant of thy seruant, and profaned his crowne, casting it on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Thou hast broken downe all his walles: thou hast layd his fortresses in ruine.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>All that goe by the way, spoyle him: he is a rebuke vnto his neighbours.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Thou hast set vp the right hand of his enemies, and made all his aduersaries to reioyce.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Thou hast also turned the edge of his sworde, and hast not made him to stand in the battell.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Thou hast caused his dignitie to decay, and cast his throne to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The dayes of his youth hast thou shortned, and couered him with shame. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Lord, howe long wilt thou hide thy selfe, for euer? shall thy wrath burne like fire?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Remember of what time I am: wherefore shouldest thou create in vaine all the children of men?  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>What man liueth, and shall not see death? shall hee deliuer his soule from the hande of the graue? Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Lord, where are thy former mercies, which thou swarest vnto Dauid in thy trueth?  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Remember, O Lord, the rebuke of thy seruants, which I beare in my bosome of all the mightie people.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>For thine enemies haue reproched thee, O Lord, because they haue reproched the footesteps of thine Anointed.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Praised be the Lord for euermore.
