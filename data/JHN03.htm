This my ioy therefore is fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He must increase, but I must decrease.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Hee that is come from an hie, is aboue all: he that is of the earth, is of the earth, and speaketh of the earth: hee that is come from heauen, is aboue all.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And what hee hath seene and heard, that he testifieth: but no man receiueth his testimonie.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He that hath receiued his testimonie, hath sealed that God is true.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For hee whome God hath sent, speaketh the woordes of God: for God giueth him not the Spirit by measure.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Father loueth the Sonne, and hath giuen all things into his hande.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Hee that beleeueth in the Sonne, hath euerlasting life, and hee that obeyeth not the Sonne, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
