See, saide hee, that thou make all thinges according to the paterne, shewed to thee in the mount.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But nowe our hie Priest hath obteined a more excellent office, in as much as he is the Mediatour of a better Testament, which is established vpon better promises.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For if that first Testament had bene vnblameable, no place should haue bene sought for the second.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For in rebuking them he saith, Beholde, the dayes will come, saith the Lord, when I shall make with the house of Israel, and with the house of Iuda a newe Testament:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Not like the Testament that I made with their fathers, in the day that I tooke them by the hand, to leade them out of the land of Egypt: for they continued not in my Testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For this is the Testament that I will make with the house of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my Lawes in their minde, and in their heart I will write them, and I wil be their God, and they shalbe my people,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they shall not teache euery man his neighbour and euery man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall knowe me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For I will bee mercifull to their vnrighteousnes, and I wil remember their sinnes and their iniquities no more.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In that he saith a new Testament, he hath abrogate the olde: nowe that which is disanulled and waxed olde, is ready to vanish away. </div><ul class='tnav'>
