And hee said, Yea.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He said moreouer, I haue a sute vnto thee. And she sayd, Say on.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then he said, Thou knowest that the kingdome was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reigne: howbeit the kingdome is turned away, and is my brothers: for it came to him by the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Nowe therefore I aske thee one request, refuse me not. And she said vnto him, Say on.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he sayd, Speake, I pray thee, vnto Salomon ye King, (for he will not say thee nay) that he giue me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Bath-sheba sayd, Well, I will speake for thee vnto the King.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Bath-sheba therefore went vnto King Salomon, to speake vnto him for Adonijah: and the King rose to meete her, and bowed himselfe vnto her, and sate downe on his throne: and he caused a seate to be set for the Kings mother, and she sate at his right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then she sayd, I desire a small request of thee, say me not nay. Then the King sayde vnto her, Aske on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>She sayd then, Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adonijah thy brother to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But King Salomon answered and sayd vnto his mother, And why doest thou aske Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? aske for him the kingdome also: for he is mine elder brother, and hath for him both Abiathar the Priest, and Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then King Salomon sware by the Lord, saying, God doe so to me and more also, if Adoniiah hath not spoken this worde against his owne life.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now therefore as ye Lord liueth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of Dauid my father, who also hath made me an house, as he promised, Adoniiah shall surely die this day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And King Salomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and hee smote him that he dyed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the King sayd vnto Abiathar the Priest, Go to Anathoth vnto thine owne fieldes: for thou art worthy of death: but I will not this day kill thee, because thou barest the Arke of the Lord God before Dauid my father, and because thou hast suffered in all, wherein my father hath bene afflicted.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So Salomon cast out Abiathar from being Priest vnto the Lord, that he might fulfill the wordes of the Lord, which he spake against the house of Eli in Shiloh.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then tidings came to Ioab: (for Ioab had turned after Adoniiah, but he turned not after Absalom) and Ioab fled vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold on the hornes of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it was tolde king Salomon, that Ioab was fled vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord, and beholde, he is by the altar. Then Salomon sent Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, saying, Goe, fall vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Benaiah came to the Tabernacle of the Lord, and sayd vnto him, Thus sayth the King, Come out. And he sayde, Nay, but I will die here. Then Benaiah brought the King worde againe, saying, Thus sayd Ioab, and thus he answered me.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the King sayde vnto him, Doe as he hath sayd, and smite him, and bury him, that thou mayest take away the blood, which Ioab shed causelesse, from me and from the house of my father.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the Lord shall bring his blood vpon his owne head: for he smote two men more righteous and better then he, and slew them with the sword, and my father Dauid knew not: to wit, Abner the sonne of Ner, captaine of the hoste of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of Iether captaine of the hoste of Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Their blood shall therefore returne vpon the head of Ioab, and on the head of his seede for euer: but vpon Dauid, and vpon his seede, and vpon his house, and vpon his throne shall there be peace for euer from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada went vp, and smote him, and slewe him, and he was buryed in his owne house in the wildernesse.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the King put Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada in his roume ouer the hoste: and the King set Zadok the Priest in the roume of Abiathar.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Afterwarde the King sent, and called Shimei, and sayde vnto him, Buylde thee an house in Ierusalem, and dwell there, and depart not thence any whither.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For that day that thou goest out, and passest ouer the riuer of Kidron, knowe assuredly, that thou shalt dye the death: thy blood shall be vpon thine owne head.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Shimei sayd vnto the King, The thing is good: as my lord the King hath sayd, so wil thy seruant doe. So Shimei dwelt in Ierusalem many dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And after three yeres two of the seruants of Shimei fled away vnto Achish sonne of Maachah King of Gath: and they tolde Shimei, saying, Behold, thy seruants be in Gath.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Shimei arose, and sadled his asse, and went to Gath to Achish, to seeke his seruantes: and Shimei went, and brought his seruants from Gath.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And it was tolde Salomon, that Shimei had gone from Ierusalem to Gath, and was come againe.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And the King sent and called Shimei, and sayde vnto him, Did I not make thee to sweare by the Lord, and protested vnto thee, saying, That day that thou goest out, and walkest any whither, knowe assuredly that thou shalt dye the death? And thou saydest vnto mee, The thing is good, that I haue heard.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Why then hast thou not kept the othe of the Lord, and the commandement wherewith I charged thee?  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>The King sayde also to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickednes whereunto thine heart is priuie, that thou diddest to Dauid my father: the Lord therefore shall bring thy wickednesse vpon thine owne head.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And let King Salomon be blessed, and the throne of Dauid stablished before the Lord for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>So the King comanded Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada: who went out and smote him that he dyed. And the kingdome was established in the hand of Salomon. </div><ul class='tnav'>
