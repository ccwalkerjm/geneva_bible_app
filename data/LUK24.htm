And they sayd vnto him, Of Iesus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet, mightie in deede and in word before God, and all people,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And howe the hie Priests, and our rulers deliuered him to be condemned to death, and haue crucified him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But we trusted that it had bene he that should haue deliuered Israel, and as touching all these things, to day is ye third day, that they were done.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yea, and certaine women among vs made vs astonied, which came early vnto the sepulchre.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seene a vision of Angels, which sayd, that he was aliue.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore certaine of them which were with vs, went to the sepulchre, and found it euen so as the women had sayd, but him they saw not.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then he sayd vnto them, O fooles and slowe of heart to beleeue all that the Prophets haue spoken!  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Ought not Christ to haue suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he began at Moses, and at all the Prophets, and interpreted vnto them in all the Scriptures the things which were written of him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they drew neere vnto ye towne, which they went to, but he made as though hee would haue gone further.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with vs: for it is towards night, and the day is farre spent. So he went in to tarie with them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to passe, as hee sate at table with them, he tooke the bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gaue it to them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then their eyes were opened, and they knewe him: and he was no more seene of them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they saide betweene themselues, Did not our heartes burne within vs, while he talked with vs by the way, and when he opened to vs the Scriptures?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they rose vp the same houre, and returned to Hierusalem, and found the Eleuen gathered together, and them that were with them,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Which said, The Lord is risen in deede, and hath appeared to Simon.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then they tolde what things were done in the way, and howe he was knowen of them in breaking of bread.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as they spake these things, Iesus himselfe stoode in the middes of them, and saide vnto them, Peace be to you.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But they were abashed and afraide, supposing that they had seene a spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then he saide vnto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore doe doutes arise in your hearts?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Beholde mine handes and my feete: for it is I my selfe: handle me, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me haue.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and feete.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And while they yet beleeued not for ioy, and wondred, he saide vnto them, Haue ye here any meate?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they gaue him a piece of a broyled fish, and of an honie combe,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And hee tooke it, and did eate before them.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he saide vnto them, These are the wordes, which I spake vnto you while I was yet with you, that all must be fulfilled which are written of me in the Lawe of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalmes.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then opened he their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the Scriptures,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And said vnto them, Thus is it written, and thus it behoued Christ to suffer, and to rise againe from the dead the third day,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And that repentance, and remission of sinnes should be preached in his Name among all nations, beginning at Hierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Nowe ye are witnesses of these things.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And beholde, I doe sende the promise of my Father vpon you: but tary ye in the citie of Hierusalem, vntill ye be endued with power from an hie.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Afterward he lead them out into Bethania, and lift vp his hands, and blessed them.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And it came to passe, that as he blessed them, he departed from them, and was caried vp into heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And they worshipped him, and returned to Hierusalem with great ioy,  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And were continually in the Temple, praysing, and lauding God, Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
