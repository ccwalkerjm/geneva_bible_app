Then came to him his disciples, and besought him, saying, Sende her away, for she crieth after vs.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But he answered, and said, I am not sent, but vnto the lost sheepe of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Yet she came, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, helpe me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he answered, and said, It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to whelps.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But she said, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the whelpes eate of the crommes, which fall from their masters table.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou desirest. And her daughter was made whole at that houre.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So Iesus went away from thence, and came neere vnto the sea of Galile, and went vp into a mountaine and sate downe there.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And great multitudes came vnto him, hauing with them, halt, blinde, dumme, maymed, and many other, and cast them downe at Iesus feete, and he healed them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In so much that the multitude wondered, to see the dumme speake, the maimed whole, the halt to goe, and the blinde to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then Iesus called his disciples vnto him, and said, I haue compassion on this multitude, because they haue continued with mee already three dayes, and haue nothing to eate: and I wil not let them depart fasting, least they faint in the way.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And his disciples saide vnto him, Whence should we get so much bread in the wildernes, as should suffice so great a multitude!  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Iesus said vnto them, How many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen, and a few litle fishes.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then he commanded the multitude to sit downe on the ground,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And tooke the seuen loaues, and the fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake them, and gaue to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they did all eate, and were sufficed: and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained, seuen baskets full.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And they that had eaten, were foure thousand men, beside women, and litle children.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then Iesus sent away the multitude, and tooke ship, and came into the partes of Magdala. </div><ul class='tnav'>
