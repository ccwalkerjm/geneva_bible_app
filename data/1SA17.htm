am not I a Philistim, and you seruaunts to Saul? chuse you a man for you, and let him come downe to me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then wil we be your seruants: but if I ouercome him, and kill him, then shall yee be our seruants, and serue vs.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Also the Philistim saide, I defie the hoste of Israel this day: giue mee a man, that we may fight together.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When Saul and all Israel heard those wordes of the Philistim, they were discouraged, and greatly afraide.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Nowe this Dauid was the sonne of an Ephrathite of Beth-lehem Iudah, named Ishai, which had eight sonnes: and this man was taken for an olde man in the daies of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the three eldest sonnes of Ishai went and followed Saul to the battel: and the names of his three sonnes that went to battell, were Eliab the Eldest, and the next Abinadab, and the thirde Shammah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Dauid was the least: and the three eldest went after Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Dauid also went, but hee returned from Saul to feede his fathers sheepe in Beth-lehem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Philistim drew neere in the morning, and euening, and continued fourtie daies.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Ishai said vnto Dauid his sone, Take nowe for thy brethren an Ephah of this parched corne, and these ten cakes, and runne to the hoste to thy brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Also carie these ten fresh cheeses vnto the captaine, and looke howe thy brethren fare, and receiue their pledge.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>(Then Saul and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistims)  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So Dauid rose vp earely in the morning, and left the sheepe with a keeper, and tooke and went as Ishai had commanded him, and came within the compasse of the hoste: and the hoste went out in araie, and shouted in the battell.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For Israel and the Philistims had put themselues in araie, armie against armie.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Dauid left the things, which hee bare, vnder the handes of the keeper of the cariage, and ranne into the hoste, and came, and asked his brethren howe they did.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And as hee talked with them, beholde, the man that was betweene the two armies, came vp, (whose name was Goliath ye Philistim of Gath) out of the armie of the Philistims, and spake such woordes, and Dauid heard them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And all the men of Israel, when they sawe the man, ranne away from him, and were sore afraied.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For euery man of Israel saide, Sawe yee not this man that commeth vp? euen to reuile Israel is he come vp: and to him that killeth him, wil the king giue great riches, and will giue him his daughter, yea, and make his fathers house free in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Dauid spake to the men that stoode with him, and sayde, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistim, and taketh away the shame from Israel? for who is this vncircumcised Philistim, that he shoulde reuile the hoste of the liuing God?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the people answered him after this maner, saying, Thus shall it be done to the man that killeth him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake vnto the men, and Eliab was verie angrie with Dauid, and sayde, Why camest thou downe hither? and with whome hast thou left those fewe sheepe in the wildernesse? I knowe thy pride and the malice of thine heart, that thou art come downe to see the battell.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Dauid sayde, What haue I nowe done? Is there not a cause?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And hee departed from him into the presence of another, and spake of the same maner, and the people answered him according to the former woordes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they that heard the wordes which Dauid spake, rehearsed them before Saul, which caused him to be brought.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Dauid saide to Saul, Let no mans heart faile him, because of him: thy seruant wil goe, and fight with this Philistim.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Saul sayde to Dauid, Thou art not able to goe against this Philistim to fight with him: for thou art a boye, and he is a man of warre from his youth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Dauid answered vnto Saul, Thy seruant kept his fathers sheepe, and there came a lyon, and likewise a beare, and tooke a sheepe out of the flocke,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I went out after him and smote him, and tooke it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by the beard, and smote him, and slue him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So thy seruaunt slue both the lyon, and the beare: therefore this vncircumcised Philistim shall be as one of them, seeing hee hath railed on the hoste of the liuing God.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Moreouer Dauid sayd, The Lord that deliuered me out of the pawe of the lyon, and out of the paw of the beare, he wil deliuer me out of the hand of this Philistim. Then Saul sayd vnto Dauid, Go, and the Lord be with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Saul put his rayment vpon Dauid, and put an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and put a brigandine vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then girded Dauid his sword vpon his rayment, and began to go: for he neuer proued it: and Dauid sayde vnto Saul, I can not goe with these: for I am not accustomed. wherefore Dauid put them off him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then tooke he his staffe in his hand, and chose him fiue smoothe stones out of a brooke, and put them in his shepheards bagge or skrippe, and his sling was in his hand, and he drewe neere to the Philistim.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And the Philistim came and drew neere vnto Dauid, and the man that bare the shielde went before him.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Now when the Philistim looked about and saw Dauid, he disdeined him: for he was but yong, ruddie, and of a comely face.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And the Philistim sayde vnto Dauid, Am I a dog, that thou commest to me with staues? And the Philistim cursed Dauid by his gods.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And the Philistim sayd to Dauid, Come to me, and I will giue thy flesh vnto the foules of the heauen, and to the beastes of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then sayd Dauid to the Philistim, Thou commest to me with a sword, and with a speare, and with a shield, but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of hostes, the God of the hoste of Israel, whom thou hast rayled vpon.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>This day shall the Lord close thee in mine hand, and I shall smite thee, and take thine head from thee, and I wil giue the carkeises of the hoste of the Philistims this daye vnto the foules of the heauen, and to the beasts of the earth, that all the world may know that Israel hath a God,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And that all this assembly may know, that the Lord saueth not with sworde nor with speare (for the battel is the Lords) and he will giue you into our handes.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And when the Philistim arose to come and drawe neere vnto Dauid, Dauid hasted and ran to fight against the Philistim.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And Dauid put his hande in his bagge, and tooke out a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistim in his forehead, that the stone sticked in his forehead, and he fell groueling to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>So Dauid ouercame the Philistim with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistim, and slew him, when Dauid had no sword in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Then Dauid ranne, and stood vpon the Philistim, and tooke his sword and drew it out of his sheath, and slewe him, and cut off his head therewith. So whe the Philistims saw, that their champion was dead, they fled.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And the men of Israel and Iudah arose, and shouted, and followed after the Philistims, vntill they came to the valley, and vnto the gates of Ekron: and the Philistims fell downe wounded by the way of Shaaraim, euen to Gath and to Ekron.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And the children of Israel returned from pursuing the Philistims, and spoyled their tents.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And Dauid tooke the head of ye Philistim, and brought it to Ierusalem, and put his armour in his tent.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>When Saul sawe Dauid go forth against the Philistim, he sayd vnto Abner the captaine of his hoste, Abner, whose sonne is this yong man? and Abner answered, As thy soule liueth, O King, I can not tell.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Then the King sayde, Enquire thou whose sonne this yong man is.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Philistim, then Abner tooke him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistim in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And Saul sayde to him, Whose sonne art thou, thou yong man? And Dauid answered, I am the sonne of thy seruant Ishai the Bethlehemite. </div><ul class='tnav'>
