If they haue persecuted me, they will persecute you also: if they haue kept my worde, they will also keepe yours.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But all these things will they doe vnto you for my Names sake, because they haue not knowen him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If I had not come and spoken vnto them, they shoulde not haue had sinne: but nowe haue they no cloke for their sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If I had not done workes among them which none other man did, they had not had sinne: but nowe haue they both seene, and haue hated both me, and my Father.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But it is that the worde might be fulfilled, that is written in their Lawe, They hated me without a cause.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But when that Comforter shall come, whom I will send vnto you from the Father, euen the Spirit of trueth, which proceedeth of the Father, he shall testifie of me.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And ye shall witnesse also, because ye haue bene with me from the beginning. </div><ul class='tnav'>
