 <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Haue the gods of the heathen deliuered them which my fathers haue destroyed? as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden, which were in Thelasar?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Where is the King of Hamath, and the King of Arpad, and the King of the citie of Shepharuaim, Hena and Iuah?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Hezekiah receiued the letter of the hande of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went vp into the house of the Lord, and Hezekiah spread it before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and saide, O Lord God of Israel, which dwellest betweene the Cherubims, thou art very God alone ouer all the kingdomes of the earth: thou hast made the heauen and the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Lord, bow downe thine eare, and heare: Lord open thine eyes and behold, and heare the wordes of Saneherib, who hath sent to blaspheme the liuing God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Trueth it is, Lord, that the Kings of Asshur haue destroyed the nations and their landes,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And haue set fire on their gods: for they were no gods, but the worke of mans hands, euen wood and stone: therefore they destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Nowe therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech thee, saue thou vs out of his hande, that all the kingdomes of the earth may knowe, that thou, O Lord, art onely God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I haue heard that which thou hast prayed me, concerning Saneherib King of Asshur.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This is the worde that the Lord hath spoken against him, O Virgine, daughter of Zion, he hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorne: O daughter of Ierusalem, he hath shaken his head at thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Whome hast thou railed on? and whome hast thou blasphemed? and against whome hast thou exalted thy voyce, and lifted vp thine eyes on hie? euen against the Holie one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>By thy messengers thou hast rayled on the Lord, and said, By the multitude of my charets I am come vp to the toppe of the mountaines, by the sides of Lebanon, and will cut downe the hie cedars thereof, and the faire firre trees thereof, and I will goe into the lodging of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I haue digged, and drunke the waters of others, and with the plant of my feete haue I dried all the floods closed in.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Hast thou not heard, howe I haue of olde time made it, and haue formed it long ago? and should I nowe bring it, that it should be destroyed, and laid on ruinous heapes, as cities defensed?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Whose inhabitants haue small power, and are afraid, and confounded: they are like the grasse of the field, and greene herbe, or grasse on ye house toppes, or as corne blasted before it be growen.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I knowe thy dwelling, yea, thy going out, and thy comming in, and thy furie against me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And because thou ragest against me, and thy tumult is come vp to mine eares, I will put mine hooke in thy nostrels, and my bridle in thy lippes, and will bring thee backe againe the same way thou camest.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And this shalbe a signe vnto thee, O Hezekiah, Thou shalt eate this yeere such things as growe of them selues, and the next yeere such as growe without sowing, and the third yeere sowe ye and reape, and plant vineyardes, and eate the fruites thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Iudah, shall againe take roote downewarde, and beare fruite vpwarde.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For out of Ierusalem shall goe a remnant, and some that shall escape out of mount Zion: the zeale of the Lord of hostes shall doe this.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord, concerning the King of Asshur, He shall not enter into this citie, nor shoote an arrowe there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a mount against it:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But he shall returne the way he came, and shall not come into this citie, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For I will defende this citie to saue it for mine owne sake, and for Dauid my seruants sake.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the same night the Angell of the Lord went out and smote in the campe of Asshur an hundreth foure score and fiue thousande: so when they rose earely in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So Saneherib King of Asshur departed, and went his way, and returned, and dwelt in Nineueh.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And as he was in the Temple worshipping Nisroch his god, Adramelech and Sharezer his sonnes slewe him with the sworde: and they escaped into the land of Ararat, and Esarhaddon his sonne reigned in his steade. </div><ul class='tnav'>
