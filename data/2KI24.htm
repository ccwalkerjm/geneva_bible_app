His mothers name also was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he did euill in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father had done.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In that time came the seruants of Nebuchad-nezzar king of Babel vp against Ierusalem: so the citie was besieged.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel came against the citie, and his seruants did besiege it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Iehoiachin the king of Iudah came out against the King of Babel, he, and his mother and his seruants, and his princes, and his eunuches: and the King of Babel tooke him in the eyght yeere of his reigne.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he caryed out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the Kings house, and brake all the vessels of gold, which Salomon King of Israel had made in the Temple of the Lord, as the Lord had saide.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he caryed away all Ierusalem, and all the princes, and all the strong men of warre, euen ten thousande into captiuitie, and all the workemen, and cunning men: so none remained sauing the poore people of the lande.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he caryed away Iehoiachin into Babel, and the Kings mother, and the Kinges wiues, and his eunuches, and the mightie of the lande caryed he away into captiuitie from Ierusalem to Babel,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And al the men of warre, euen seuen thousand, and carpenters, and lockesmithes a thousande: all that were strong and apt for warre, did the King of Babel bring to Babel captiues.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the King of Babel made Mattaniah his vncle King in his steade, and changed his name to Zedekiah.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Zedekiah was one and twentie yeere olde, when he began to reigne, and he reigned eleuen yeeres in Ierusalem. His mothers name also was Hamutal the daughter of Ieremiah of Libnah.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he did euill in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Iehoiakim had done.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore certainly the wrath of the Lord was against Ierusalem and Iudah vntill he cast them out of his sight.
