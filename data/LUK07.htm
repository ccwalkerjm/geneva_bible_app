A reede shaken with the winde?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft rayment? beholde, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and liue delicately, are in Kings courtes.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But what went ye foorth to see? A Prophet? yea, I say to you, and greater then a Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>This is he of whom it is written, Beholde, I sende my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For I say vnto you, there is no greater Prophet then Iohn, among them that are begotten of women: neuerthelesse, hee that is the least in the kingdome of God, is greater then he.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then all the people that heard, and the Publicanes iustified God, being baptized with the baptisme of Iohn.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But the Pharises and the expounders of the Law despised the counsell of God against themselues, and were not baptized of him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Lord saide, Whereunto shall I liken the men of this generation? and what thing are they like vnto?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They are like vnto litle children sitting in the market place, and crying one to another, and saying, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced: we haue mourned to you, and ye haue not wept.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For Iohn Baptist came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine: and ye say, He hath the deuil.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The Sonne of man is come, and eateth and drinketh: and ye say, Beholde, a man which is a glutton, and a drinker of wine, a friend of Publicanes and sinners:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But wisdome is iustified of all her children.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And one of the Pharises desired him that hee would eate with him: and hee went into the Pharises house, and sate downe at table.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And beholde, a woman in the citie, which was a sinner, when she knewe that Iesus sate at table in the Pharises house, shee brought a boxe of oyntment.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And shee stoode at his feete behinde him weeping, and began to wash his feete with teares, and did wipe them with the heares of her head, and kissed his feete, and anoynted them with the oyntment.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Nowe when the Pharise which bade him, saw it, he spake within himselfe, saying, If this man were a Prophet, hee woulde surely haue knowen who, and what maner of woman this is which toucheth him: for she is a sinner.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Iesus answered, and saide vnto him, Simon, I haue somewhat to say vnto thee. And he said, Master, say on.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>There was a certaine lender which had two detters: the one ought fiue hundreth pence, and the other fiftie:  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>When they had nothing to pay, he forgaue them both: Which of them therefore, tell mee, will loue him most?  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Simon answered, and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgaue most. And he said vnto him, Thou hast truely iudged.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then he turned to the woman, and said vnto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entred into thine house, and thou gauest mee no water to my feete: but she hath washed my feete with teares, and wiped them with the heares of her head.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Thou gauest me no kisse: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kisse my feete.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Mine head with oyle thou didest not anoint: but she hath anoynted my feete with oyntment.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Wherefore I say vnto thee, many sinnes are forgiuen her: for she loued much. To whom a litle is forgiuen, he doeth loue a litle.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And he saide vnto her, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And they that sate at table with him, began to say within themselues, Who is this that euen forgiueth sinnes?  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saued thee: goe in peace. </div><ul class='tnav'>
