Let not man therefore put asunder that, which God hath coupled together.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They said to him, Why did then Moses commaund to giue a bill of diuorcement, and to put her away?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He sayd vnto them, Moses, because of the hardnesse of your heart, suffered you to put away your wiues: but from the beginning it was not so.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I say therefore vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away his wife, except it be for whoredome, and marry another, committeth adulterie: and whosoeuer marieth her which is diuorced, doeth commit adulterie.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then sayd his disciples to him, If the matter be so betweene man and wife, it is not good to marry.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But he sayd vnto them, All men cannot receiue this thing, saue they to whom it is giuen.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For there are some eunuches, which were so borne of their mothers belly: and there be some eunuches, which be gelded by men: and there be some eunuches, which haue gelded them selues for the kingdome of heauen. He that is able to receiue this, let him receiue it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then were brought to him litle children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Iesus sayd, Suffer the litle children, and forbid them not to come to me: for of such is the kingdome of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when he had put his hands on them, he departed thence.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And beholde, one came and sayd vnto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I doe, that I may haue eternall life?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, eue God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keepe ye commandemets.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He sayd to him, Which? And Iesus sayde, These, Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Honour thy father and mother: and thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The yong man sayd vnto him, I haue obserued all these things from my youth: what lacke I yet?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Iesus sayd vnto him, If thou wilt be perfite, go, sell that thou hast, and giue it to the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come, and follow me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when the yong man heard that saying, he went away sorowfull: for he had great possessions.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Iesus sayd vnto his disciples, Verely I say vnto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdome of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And againe I say vnto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into ye kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And whe his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amased, saying, Who then can be saued?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Iesus behelde them, and sayde vnto them, With men this is vnpossible, but with God all things are possible.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then answered Peter, and said to him, Beholde, we haue forsaken all, and followed thee: what therefore shall we haue?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Iesus said vnto them, Verely I say to you, that when the Sonne of man shall sit in the throne of his maiestie, ye which folowed me in the regeneration, shall sit also vpon twelue thrones and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And whosoeuer shall forsake houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my Names sake, he shall receiue an hundreth folde more, and shall inherite euerlasting life.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But many that are first, shalbe last, and the last shalbe first. </div><ul class='tnav'>
