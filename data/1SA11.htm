And the feare of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when he nombred them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundreth thousande men: and the men of Iudah thirtie thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then they saide vnto the messengers that came, So say vnto the men of Iabesh Gilead, To morowe by then the sunne be hote, ye shall haue helpe. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Iabesh, which were glad.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore the men of Iabesh sayde, To morowe we will come out vnto you, and yee shall doe with vs all that pleaseth you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when the morowe was come, Saul put the people in three bandes, and they came in vpon the hoste in the morning watche, and slewe the Ammonites vntill the heate of the day: and they that remained, were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the people said vnto Samuel, Who is he that saide, Shall Saul reigne ouer vs? bring those men that we may slaie them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But Saul said, There shall no man die this day: for to day the Lord hath saued Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then saide Samuel vnto ye people, Come, that we may goe to Gilgal, and renue the kingdome there.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So all the people went to Gilgal, and made Saul King there before the Lord in Gilgal: and there they offered peace offerings before the Lord: and there Saul and all the men of Israel reioyced exceedingly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
