Is not he that sitteth at table? And I am among you as he that serueth.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And yee are they which haue continued with me in my tentations.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Therefore I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed vnto me,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>That ye may eate, and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and sit on seates, and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Lord saide, Simon, Simon, beholde, Satan hath desired you, to winowe you as wheate.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not: therefore when thou art conuerted, strengthen thy brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he said vnto him, Lord, I am ready to goe with thee into prison, and to death.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cocke shall not crowe this day, before thou hast thrise denied that thou knewest me.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he saide vnto them, When I sent you without bagge, and scrip, and shooes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then he said to them, But nowe he that hath a bagge, let him take it, and likewise a scrip: and hee that hath none, let him sell his coate, and buy a sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For I say vnto you, That yet the same which is written, must be perfourmed in me, Euen with the wicked was he nombred: for doubtlesse those things which are written of me, haue an ende.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And they said, Lord, beholde, here are two swordes. And he said vnto them, It is ynough.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he came out, and went (as he was wont) to the mount of Oliues: and his disciples also followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And when hee came to the place, hee said to them, Pray, lest ye enter into tentation.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he was drawen aside from them about a stones cast, and kneeled downe, and prayed,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Saying, Father, if thou wilt, take away this cuppe from mee: neuerthelesse, not my will, but thine be done.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And there appeared an Angell vnto him from heauen, comforting him.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>But being in an agonie, hee prayed more earnestly: and his sweate was like drops of blood, trickling downe to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he rose vp from prayer, and came to his disciples, and found them sleeping for heauinesse.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he said vnto them, Why sleepe ye? rise and pray, least ye enter into tentation.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And while he yet spake, beholde, a companie, and he that was called Iudas one of the twelue, went before them, and came neere vnto Iesus to kisse him.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And Iesus saide vnto him, Iudas, betrayest thou the Sonne of man with a kisse?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Now when they which were about him, saw what would follow, they said vnto him, Lord, shall we smite with sworde?  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And one of them smote a seruant of the hie Priest, and strooke off his right eare.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Then Iesus answered, and said, Suffer them thus farre: and he touched his eare, and healed him.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then Iesus said vnto the hie Priests, and captaines of the Temple, and the Elders which were come to him, Bee ye come out as vnto a theefe with swordes and staues?  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>When I was dayly with you in the Temple, yee stretched not foorth the handes against mee: but this is your very houre, and the power of darkenesse.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Then tooke they him, and led him, and brought him to the hie Priestes house. And Peter followed afarre off.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And when they had kindled a fire in the middes of the hall, and were set downe together, Peter also sate downe among them.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And a certaine mayde behelde him as hee sate by the fire, and hauing well looked on him, said, This man was also with him.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And after a little while, another man sawe him, and saide, Thou art also of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And about the space of an houre after, a certaine other affirmed, saying. Verely euen this man was with him: for he is also a Galilean.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And Peter saide, Man, I knowe not what thou sayest. And immediatly while hee yet spake, the cocke crewe.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Then the Lord turned backe, and looked vpon Peter: and Peter remembred the worde of the Lord, how he had said vnto him, Before the cocke crowe, thou shalt denie me thrise.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And the men that helde Iesus, mocked him, and strooke him.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>And when they had blindfolded him, they smote him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophecie who it is that smote thee.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And many other thinges blasphemously spake they against him.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And assoone as it was day, the Elders of the people, and the hie Priests and the Scribes came together, and led him into their councill,  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Saying, Art thou that Christ? tell vs. And he said vnto them, If I tell you, ye wil not beleeue it.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>And if also I aske you, you will not answere me, nor let me goe.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>Hereafter shall the Sonne of man sit at the right hand of the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>Then sayd they all, Art thou then ye Sonne of God? And he sayd to them, Ye say, that I am.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>Then sayd they, What neede we any further witnes? for we our selues haue heard it of his owne mouth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
