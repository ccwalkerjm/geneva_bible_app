<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 78</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>A Psalme to give instruction committed to Asaph. Heare my doctrine, O my people: incline your eares vnto the wordes of my mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare high sentences of olde.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Which we haue heard and knowen, and our fathers haue tolde vs.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wee will not hide them from their children but to the generation to come we wil shewe the praises of the Lord his power also, and his wonderful woorkes that he hath done:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>How he established a testimonie in Iaakob, and ordeined a Law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they shoulde teache their children:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>That the posteritie might knowe it, and the children, which should be borne, should stand vp, and declare it to their children:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the workes of God but keepe his commandements:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And not to bee as their fathers, a disobedient and rebellious generation: a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirite was not faithfull vnto God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The children of Ephraim being armed and shooting with the bowe, turned backe in the day of battell.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They kept not the couenant of God, but refused to walke in his Lawe,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And forgate his Actes, and his wonderfull woorkes that he had shewed them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hee did marueilous thinges in the sight of their fathers in the lande of Egypt: euen in the fielde of Zoan.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He deuided the Sea, and led them through: he made also the waters to stand as an heape.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In the day time also hee led them with a cloude, and all the night with a light of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He claue the rockes in the wildernes, and gaue them drinke as of the great depths.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He brought floods also out of the stonie rocke; so that hee made the waters to descend like the riuers.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yet they sinned stil against him, and prouoked the Highest in the wildernesse,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And tempted God in their heartes in requiring meate for their lust.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They spake against God also, saying, Can God prepare a table in the wildernesse?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, he smote the rocke, that the water gushed out, and the streames ouerflowed: can hee giue bread also? or prepare flesh for his people?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord heard and was angrie, and the fire was kindled in Iaakob, and also wrath came vpon Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Because they beleeued not in God, and trusted not in his helpe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet he had comanded the clouds aboue, and had opened the doores of heauen,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And had rained downe MAN vpon them for to eate, and had giuen them of the wheate of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Man did eate the bread of Angels: hee sent them meate ynough.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He caused the Eastwinde to passe in the heauen, and through his power he brought in the Southwinde.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Hee rained flesh also vpon them as dust, and feathered foule as the sand of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And hee made it fall in the middes of their campe euen round about their habitations.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So they did eate and were well filled: for he gaue them their desire.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They were not turned from their lust, but the meate was yet in their mouthes,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>When the wrath of God came euen vpon them, and slew the strongest of them, and smote downe the chosen men in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For all this, they sinned stil, and beleeued not his wonderous woorkes.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore their daies did hee consume in vanitie, and their yeeres hastily.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And when hee slewe them, they sought him and they returned, and sought God earely.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they remembred that God was their strength, and the most high God their redeemer.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But they flattered him with their mouth, and dissembled with him with their tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For their heart was not vpright with him: neither were they faithfull in his couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Yet he being merciful forgaue their iniquitie, and destroied them not, but oft times called backe his anger, and did not stirre vp all his wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For he remembered that they were flesh: yea, a winde that passeth and commeth not againe.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>How oft did they prouoke him in the wildernes? and grieue him in the desert?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Yea, they returned, and tempted God, and limited the Holie one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he deliuered them from the enemie,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Nor him that set his signes in Egypt, and his wonders in the fielde of Zoan,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And turned their riuers into blood, and their floods, that they could not drinke.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Hee sent a swarme of flies among them, which deuoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>He gaue also their fruites vnto the caterpiller, and their labour vnto the grassehopper.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He destroied their vines with haile, and their wilde figge trees with the hailestone.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He gaue their cattell also to the haile, and their flockes to the thunderboltes.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Hee cast vpon them the fiercenesse of his anger, indignation and wrath, and vexation by the sending out of euill Angels.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>He made a way to his anger: he spared not their soule from death, but gaue their life to the pestilence,  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And smote al the firstborne in Egypt, euen the beginning of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>But hee made his people to goe out like sheepe, and led them in the wildernes like a flocke.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Yea, he caried them out safely, and they feared not, and the Sea couered their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And he brought them vnto the borders of his Sanctuarie: euen to this Mountaine, which his right hand purchased.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>He cast out the heathe also before them, and caused them to fall to the lot of his inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Yet they tempted, and prouoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies,  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>But turned backe and delt falsely like their fathers: they turned like a deceitfull bowe.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And they prouoked him to anger with their high places, and mooued him to wrath with their grauen images.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>God heard this and was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>So that hee forsooke the habitation of Shilo, euen the Tabernacle where hee dwelt among men,  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And deliuered his power into captiuitie, and his beautie into the enemies hand.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And hee gaue vp his people to the sworde, and was angrie with his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>The fire deuoured their chosen men, and their maides were not praised.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Their Priestes fell by the sworde, and their widowes lamented not.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>But the Lord awaked as one out of sleepe, and as a strong man that after his wine crieth out,  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And smote his enemies in the hinder parts, and put them to a perpetuall shame.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Yet he refused the tabernacle of Ioseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>But chose the tribe of Iudah, and mount Zion which he loued.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And he built his Sanctuarie as an high palace, like the earth, which he stablished for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>He chose Dauid also his seruant, and tooke him from the shepefolds.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>Euen from behinde the ewes with yong brought he him to feede his people in Iaakob, and his inheritance in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>So he fed them according to the simplicitie of his heart, and guided them by the discretion of his hands. </div><ul class='tnav'>
