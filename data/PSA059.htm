When Saul sent and they did watch the house to kill him. O my God, deliuer mee from mine enemies: defend me from them that rise vp against me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Deliuer me from the wicked doers, and saue me from the bloody men.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For loe, they haue layd waite for my soule: the mightie men are gathered against me, not for mine offence, nor for my sinne, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They runne and prepare themselues without a fault on my part: arise therefore to assist me, and beholde.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Euen thou, O Lord God of hostes, O God of Israel awake to visit all the heathen, and be not merciful vnto all that transgresse maliciously. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They goe to and from in the euening: they barke like dogs, and goe about the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Behold, they brag in their talke, and swords are in their lips: for, Who, say they, doeth heare?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But thou, O Lord, shalt haue them in derision, and thou shalt laugh at all the heathen.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He is strong: but I will waite vpon thee: for God is my defence.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My mercifull God will preuent me: God wil let me see my desire vpon mine enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Slay them not, least my people forget it: but scatter them abroad by thy power, and put them downe, O Lord our shield,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For the sinne of their mouth, and the words of their lips: and let them be taken in their pride, euen for their periurie and lies, that they speake.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Consume them in thy wrath: consume them that they be no more: and let them knowe that God ruleth in Iaakob, euen vnto the ends of the world. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And in the euening they shall go to and from, and barke like dogs, and go about the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They shall runne here and there for meate: and surely they shall not be satisfied, though they tary all night.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But I wil sing of thy power, and will prayse thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast bene my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Vnto thee, O my Strength, wil I sing: for God is my defence, and my mercifull God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
