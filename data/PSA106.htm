<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 106</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord because he is good, for his mercie endureth for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Who can expresse the noble actes of the Lord, or shewe forth all his prayse?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Blessed are they that keepe iudgement, and doe righteousnesse at all times.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Remember me, O Lord, with the fauour of thy people: visite me with thy saluation,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That I may see the felicitie of thy chosen, and reioyce in the ioy of thy people, and glorie with thine inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We haue sinned with our fathers: we haue committed iniquitie, and done wickedly.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Our fathers vnderstoode not thy wonders in Egypt, neither remembred they the multitude of thy mercies, but rebelled at the Sea, euen at the red sea.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse he saued them for his Names sake, that he might make his power to be knowen.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he rebuked the red Sea, and it was dryed vp, and he led them in the deepe, as in the wildernesse.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he saued them from ye aduersaries hand, and deliuered them from ye hand of the enemie.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the waters couered their oppressours: not one of them was left.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then beleeued they his wordes, and sang prayse vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But incontinently they forgate his workes: they wayted not for his counsell,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But lusted with concupiscence in the wildernes, and tempted God in the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then he gaue them their desire: but he sent leannesse into their soule.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They enuied Moses also in the tentes, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore the earth opened and swallowed vp Dathan, and couered the companie of Abiram.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the fire was kindled in their assembly: the flame burnt vp the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They made a calfe in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thus they turned their glory into the similitude of a bullocke, that eateth grasse.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They forgate God their Sauiour, which had done great things in Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wonderous woorkes in the lande of Ham, and fearefull things by the red Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore he minded to destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stand in the breach before him to turne away his wrath, least he shoulde destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Also they contemned that pleasant land, and beleeued not his worde,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But murmured in their tentes, and hearkened not vnto the voice of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore hee lifted vp his hande against them, to destroy them in the wildernesse,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And to destroy their seede among the nations, and to scatter them throughout the countries.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They ioyned themselues also vnto Baalpeor, and did eate the offrings of the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Thus they prouoked him vnto anger with their owne inuentions, and the plague brake in vpon them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But Phinehas stoode vp, and executed iudgement, and the plague was staied.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it was imputed vnto him for righteousnes from generation to generation for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They angred him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was punished for their sakes,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Because they vexed his spirite, so that hee spake vnaduisedly with his lippes.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Neither destroied they the people, as the Lord had commanded them,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their workes,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And serued their idoles, which were their ruine.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Yea, they offered their sonnes, and their daughters vnto deuils,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And shed innocent blood, euen the blood of their sonnes, and of their daughters, whome they offred vnto the idoles of Canaan, and the lande was defiled with blood.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Thus were they steined with their owne woorkes, and went a whoring with their owne inuentions.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and he abhorred his owne inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And hee gaue them into the hande of the heathen: and they that hated them, were lordes ouer them.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were humbled vnder their hand.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Many a time did hee deliuer them, but they prouoked him by their counsels: therefore they were brought downe by their iniquitie.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Yet hee sawe when they were in affliction, and he heard their crie.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he remembred his couenant towarde them and repented according to the multitude of his mercies,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And gaue them fauour in the sight of all them that lead them captiues.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Saue vs, O Lord our God, and gather vs from among the heathen, that we may praise thine holy Name, and glorie in thy praise.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for euer and euer, and let all the people say, So be it. Praise yee the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
