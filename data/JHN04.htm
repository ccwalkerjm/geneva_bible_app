<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Nowe when the Lord knew, how the Pharises had heard, that Iesus made and baptized moe disciples then Iohn,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>(Though Iesus himselfe baptized not: but his disciples)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Hee left Iudea, and departed againe into Galile.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he must needes goe through Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then came hee to a citie of Samaria called Sychar, neere vnto the possession that Iacob gaue to his sonne Ioseph.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And there was Iacobs well. Iesus then wearied in the iourney, sate thus on the well: it was about the sixt houre.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There came a woman of Samaria to drawe water. Iesus sayd vnto her, Giue me drinke.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For his disciples were gone away into the citie, to buy meate.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then sayde the woman of Samaria vnto him, Howe is it, that thou being a Iewe, askest drinke of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Iewes meddle not with the Samaritans.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Iesus answered and saide vnto her, If thou knewest that gift of God, and who it is that saieth to thee, Giue mee drinke, thou wouldest haue asked of him, and hee woulde haue giuen thee, water of life.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The woman saide vnto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to drawe with, and the well is deepe: from whence then hast thou that water of life?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Art thou greater then our father Iacob, which gaue vs the well, and hee himselfe dranke thereof, and his sonnes, and his cattell?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Iesus answered, and said vnto her, Whosoeuer drinketh of this water, shall thirst againe:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shall giue him, shall neuer be more a thirst: but the water that I shall giue him, shalbe in him a well of water, springing vp into euerlasting life.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The woman said vnto him, Syr, giue me of that water, that I may not thirst, neither come hither to drawe.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Iesus said vnto her, Go, call thine husband, and come hither.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The woman answered, and saide, I haue no husband. Iesus said vnto her, Thou hast well said, I haue no husband.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For thou hast had fiue husbands, and he whom thou nowe hast, is not thine husband: that saidest thou truely.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The woman saide vnto him, Sir, I see that thou art a Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountaine, and ye say, that in Ierusalem is the place where men ought to worship.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Iesus saide vnto her, Woman, beleeue me, the houre commeth, when ye shall neither in this mountaine, nor at Hierusalem worship ye Father.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ye worship that which ye knowe not: we worship that which we knowe: for saluation is of the Iewes.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the houre commeth, and nowe is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit, and trueth: for the Father requireth euen such to worship him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>God is a Spirite, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The woman said vnto him, I knowe well that Messias shall come which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell vs all things.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Iesus said vnto her, I am he, that speake vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And vpon that, came his disciples, and marueiled that he talked with a woman: yet no man said vnto him, What askest thou? or why talkest thou with her?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the citie, and said to the men,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Come, see a man which hath tolde me all things that euer I did: is not he that Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then they went out of the citie, and came vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In the meane while, the disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eate.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But he said vnto them, I haue meate to eate that ye know not of.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then said ye disciples betweene themselues, Hath any man brought him meate?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Iesus saide vnto them, My meate is that I may doe the will of him that sent me, and finish his worke.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Say not ye, There are yet foure moneths, and then commeth haruest? Beholde, I say vnto you, Lift vp your eyes, and looke on the regions: for they are white alreadie vnto haruest.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he that reapeth, receiueth rewarde, and gathereth fruite vnto life eternall, that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, might reioyce together.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For herein is the saying true, that one soweth, and an other reapeth.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I sent you to reape that, whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entred into their labours.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Nowe many of the Samaritans of that citie beleeued in him, for the saying of the woman which testified, He hath tolde me all things that euer I did.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then when the Samaritans were come vnto him, they besought him, that he woulde tarie with them: and he abode there two dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And many moe beleeued because of his owne word.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they said vnto the woman, Nowe we beleeue, not because of thy saying: for we haue heard him our selues, and knowe that this is in deede that Christ the Sauiour of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So two dayes after he departed thence, and went into Galile.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For Iesus himselfe had testified, that a Prophet hath none honour in his owne countrey.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then when he was come into Galile, the Galileans receiued him, which had seene all the things that he did at Hierusalem at the feast: for they went also vnto the feast.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Iesus came againe into Cana a towne of Galile, where he had made of water, wine. And there was a certaine ruler, whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>When he heard that Iesus was come out of Iudea into Galile, he went vnto him, and besought him that he would goe downe, and heale his sonne: for he was euen ready to die.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Then saide Iesus vnto him, Except ye see signes and wonders, ye will not beleeue.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The ruler said vnto him, Syr, goe downe before my sonne dye.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Iesus said vnto him, Go thy way, thy sonne liueth: and the man beleeued the worde that Iesus had spoken vnto him, and went his way.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And as he was nowe going downe, his seruants met him, saying, Thy sonne liueth.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then enquired he of them the houre when he began to amend. And they said vnto him, Yesterday the seuenth houre the feuer left him.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Then the father knew, that it was the same houre in the which Iesus had said vnto him, Thy sonne liueth. And he beleeued, and all his houshold.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>This second miracle did Iesus againe, after he was come out of Iudea into Galile. </div><ul class='tnav'>
