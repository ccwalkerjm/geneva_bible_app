how fierce is this great wrath?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they shall answere, Because they haue forsaken the couenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which he had made with them, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And went and serued other gods and worshipped them: euen gods which they knewe not, and which had giuen them nothing,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore the wrath of the Lord waxed hot against this land, to bring vpon it euery curse that is written in this booke.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And ye Lord hath rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and hath cast them into another land, as appeareth this day.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things reueiled belong vnto vs, and to our children for euer, that we may doe all the wordes of this Lawe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
