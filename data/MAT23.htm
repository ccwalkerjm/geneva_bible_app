These ought ye to haue done, and not to haue left the other.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ye blinde guides, which straine out a gnat, and swallowe a camell.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye make cleane the vtter side of the cup, and of the platter: but within they are ful of briberie and excesse.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Thou blinde Pharise, cleanse first the inside of the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be cleane also.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye are like vnto whited tombes, which appeare beautifull outward, but are within full of dead mens bones, and all filthines.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So are ye also: for outwarde ye appeare righteous vnto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisie and iniquitie.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Wo be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye build the tombes of the Prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And say, If we had bene in the dayes of our fathers, we would not haue bene partners with them in the blood of the Prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So then ye be witnesses vnto your selues, that ye are the children of them that murthered the Prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Fulfill ye also ye measure of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>O serpents, the generation of vipers, howe should ye escape the damnation of hell!  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Wherefore beholde, I send vnto you Prophets, and wise men, and Scribes, and of them ye shall kill and crucifie: and of them shall ye scourge in your Synagogues, and persecute from citie to citie,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>That vpon you may come all the righteous blood that was shed vpon the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous, vnto the blood of Zacharias the sonne of Barachias, whome ye slewe betweene the Temple and the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto you, all these things shall come vpon this generation.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Hierusalem, Hierusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent to thee, how often would I haue gathered thy children together, as the henne gathereth her chickins vnder her wings, and ye would not!  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Beholde, your habitation shalbe left vnto you desolate,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For I say vnto you, ye shall not see mee henceforth till that ye say, Blessed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
