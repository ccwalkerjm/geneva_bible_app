I prayse you not.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I haue receiued of the Lord that which I also haue deliuered vnto you, to wit, That the Lord Iesus in the night when he was betrayed, tooke bread:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when hee had giuen thankes, hee brake it, and sayde, Take, eate: this is my body, which is broken for you: this doe ye in remembrance of me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>After the same maner also he tooke the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the Newe Testament in my blood: this doe as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as often as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye shewe the Lords death till hee come.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wherefore, whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke the cup of the Lord vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Let euery man therefore examine himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For he that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, because he discerneth not the Lords body.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For this cause many are weake, and sicke among you, and many sleepe.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For if we would iudge our selues, we should not be iudged.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But when we are iudged, we are chastened of the Lord, because we should not be condemned with the world.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tary one for another.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And if any man be hungry, let him eate at home, that ye come not together vnto condemnation. Other things will I set in order when I come. </div><ul class='tnav'>
