Then Ioseph saide vnto them, Are not interpretations of God? tell them me nowe.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So the chiefe butler tolde his dreame to Ioseph, and said vnto him, In my dreame, behold, a vine was before me,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And in the vine were three branches, and as it budded, her flowre came foorth: and the clusters of grapes waxed ripe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I had Pharaohs cup in mine hande, and I tooke the grapes, and wrung the into Pharaohs cup, and I gaue the cup into Pharaohs hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Ioseph sayde vnto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three braunches are three dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Within three dayes shall Pharaoh lift vp thine head, and restore thee vnto thine office, and thou shalt giue Pharaohs cup into his hand after the olde maner, when thou wast his butler.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But haue me in remembrance with thee, when thou art in good case, and shew mercie, I pray thee, vnto me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring me out of this house.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I was stollen away by theft out of the land of the Ebrewes, and here also haue I done nothing, wherefore they should put mee in the dungeon.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when the chiefe baker sawe that the interpretation was good, hee saide vnto Ioseph, Also mee thought in my dreame that I had three white baskets on mine head.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And in the vppermost basket there was of all maner baken meates for Pharaoh: and the birdes did eate them out of the basket vpon mine head.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Ioseph answered, and saide, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three dayes:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Within three dayes shall Pharaoh take thine head from thee, and shall hang thee on a tree, and the birdes shall eate thy flesh from off thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And so the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday, hee made a feast vnto all his seruants: and hee lifted vp the head of the chiefe butler, and the head of the chiefe baker among his seruants.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he restored the chiefe butler vnto his butlershippe, who gaue the cup into Pharaohs hande,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But he hanged the chiefe baker, as Ioseph had interpreted vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet the chiefe butler did not remember Ioseph, but forgate him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
