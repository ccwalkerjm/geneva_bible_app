If a man haue an hundreth sheepe, and one of them be gone astray, doeth he not leaue ninetie and nine, and go into the mountaines, and seeke that which is gone astray?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if so be that he finde it, verely I say vnto you, he reioyceth more of that sheepe, then of the ninetie and nine which went not astray:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So is it not ye wil of your Father which is in heauen, that one of these litle ones should perish.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moreouer, if thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone: if he heare thee, thou hast wonne thy brother.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But if he heare thee not, take yet with thee one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses euery worde may be confirmed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And if he refuse to heare them, tell it vnto the Church: and if he refuse to heare the Church also, let him be vnto thee as an heathen man, and a Publicane.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto you, Whatsoeuer ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer ye loose on earth, shalbe loosed in heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Againe, verely I say vnto you, that if two of you shall agree in earth vpon any thing, whatsoeuer they shall desire, it shall be giuen them of my Father which is in heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the mids of them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then came Peter to him, and said, Master, howe oft shall my brother sinne against me, and I shall forgiue him? vnto seuen times?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Iesus said vnto him, I say not to thee, Vnto seuen times, but, Vnto seuentie times seuen times.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto a certaine King, which would take an account of his seruants.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought vnto him, which ought him ten thousand talents.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And because he had nothing to pay, his Lord commanded him to be solde, and his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and the dette to be payed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The seruant therefore fell downe, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, refraine thine anger toward me, and I will pay thee all.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then that seruants Lord had compassion, and loosed him, and forgaue him the dette.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But when the seruant was departed, hee found one of his felow seruants, which ought him an hundred pence, and he layde hands on him, and thratled him, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then his fellow seruant fell downe at his feete, and besought him, saying, Refraine thine anger towards me, and I will pay thee all.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Yet he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the dette.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when his other felowe seruants sawe what was done, they were very sory, and came, and declared vnto their Lord all that was done.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then his Lord called him vnto him, and sayd to him, O euil seruant, I forgaue thee all that dette, because thou prayedst me.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Oughtest not thou also to haue had pitie on thy fellowe seruant, euen as I had pitie on thee?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So his Lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormentours, till he should pay all that was due to him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So likewise shall mine heauenly Father doe vnto you, except ye forgiue from your hearts, eche one to his brother their trespasses. </div><ul class='tnav'>
