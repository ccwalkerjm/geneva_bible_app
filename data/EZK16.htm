<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Again, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Sonne of man, cause Ierusalem to knowe her abominations,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And say, Thus saith the Lord God vnto Ierusalem, Thine habitation and thy kindred is of the land of Canaan: thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And in thy natiuitie whe thou wast borne, thy nauell was not cut: thou wast not washed in water to soften thee: thou wast not salted with salt, nor swadled in cloutes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>None eye pitied thee to do any of these vnto thee, for to haue compassion vpon thee, but thou wast cast out in the open fielde to the contempt of thy person in ye day that thou wast borne.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when I passed by thee, I saw thee polluted in thine owne blood, and I said vnto thee, whe thou wast in thy blood, Thou shalt liue: euen when thou wast in thy blood, I saide vnto thee, Thou shalt liue.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I haue caused thee to multiplie as the bud of the fielde, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou hast gotten excellent ornaments: thy breastes are facioned, thine heare is growen, where as thou wast naked and bare.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Nowe when I passed by thee, and looked vpon thee, beholde, thy time was as the time of loue, and I spred my skirtes ouer thee, and couered thy filthines: yea, I sware vnto thee, and entred into a couenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then washed I thee with water: yea, I washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oyle.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I clothed thee also with broydred worke, and shod thee with badgers skin: and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I couered thee with silke.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets vpon thine handes, and a chaine on thy necke.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I put a frontlet vpon thy face, and earings in thine eares, and a beautifull crowne vpon thine head.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thus wast thou deckt with gold and siluer, and thy rayment was of fine linen, and silke, and broydred worke: thou didest eate fine floure, and honie and oyle, and thou wast very beautifull, and thou didest grow vp into a kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And thy name was spred among the heathen for thy beautie: for it was perfite through my beautie which I had set vpon thee, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nowe thou didest trust in thine owne beautie, and playedst the harlot, because of thy renowne, and hast powred out thy fornications on euery one that passed by, thy desire was to him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou didest take thy garments, and deckedst thine hie places with diuers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like thinges shall not come, neither hath any done so.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou hast also taken thy faire iewels made of my golde and of my siluer, which I had giuen thee, and madest to thy selfe images of men, and didest commit whoredome with them,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And tookest thy broydred garments, and coueredst them: and thou hast set mine oyle and my perfume before them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My meate also, which I gaue thee, as fine floure, oyle, and honie, wherewith I fedde thee, thou hast euen set it before them for a sweete sauour: thus it was, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moreouer thou hast taken thy sonnes and thy daughters, whome thou hast borne vnto me, and these hast thou sacrificed vnto them, to be deuoured: is this thy whoredome a small matter?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That thou hast slaine my children, and deliuered them to cause them to passe through fire for them?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And in all thine abominations and whoredomes thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And beside all thy wickednes (wo, wo vnto thee, saith the Lord God)  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thou hast also built vnto thee an hie place, and hast made thee an hie place in euery streete.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thou hast built thine hie place at euery corner of the way, and hast made thy beautie to be abhorred: thou hast opened thy feete to euery one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredome.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, which haue great members, and hast encreased thy whoredome, to prouoke me.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Beholde, therefore I did stretche out mine hand ouer thee, and will diminish thine ordinarie, and deliuer thee vnto the will of them that hate thee, euen to the daughters of the Philistims, which are ashamed of thy wicked way.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insaciable: yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Thou hast moreouer multiplied thy fornication from the land of Canaan vnto Caldea, and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Howe weake is thine heart, saith the Lord God, seeing thou doest all these thinges, euen the worke of a presumptuous whorish woman?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In that thou buildest thine hie place in the corner of euery way, and makest thine hie place in euery streete, and hast not bene as an harlot that despiseth a reward,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But as a wife that playeth the harlot, and taketh others for her husband:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They giue giftes to all other whores, but thou giuest giftes vnto all thy louers, and rewardest them, that they may come vnto thee on euery side for thy fornication.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy fornications, neither the like fornication shall be after thee: for in that thou giuest a rewarde, and no reward is giuen vnto thee, therefore thou art contrary.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Wherefore, O harlot, heare the worde of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord God, Because thy shame was powred out, and thy filthinesse discouered through thy fornications with thy louers, and with all the idoles of thine abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didest offer vnto them,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Beholde, therefore I wil gather all thy louers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loued, with al them that thou hast hated: I will euen gather them round about against thee, and will discouer thy filthines vnto them, that they may see all thy filthines.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And I wil iudge thee after ye maner of them that are harlots, and of them that shead blood, and I wil giue thee the blood of wrath and ielousie.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>I will also giue thee into their handes, and they shall destroy thine hie place, and shall breake downe thine hie places. they shall strippe thee also out of thy clothes, and shall take thy faire iewels, and leaue thee naked and bare.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>They shall also bring vp a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swordes.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And they shall burne vp thine houses with fire, and execute iudgements vpon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt giue no reward any more.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>So will I make my wrath towarde thee to rest, and my ielousie shall depart from thee, and I will cease and be no more angrie.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Because thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, but hast prouoked me with all these things, behold, therefore I also haue brought thy way vpon thine head, sayeth the Lord God: yet hast not thou had consideration of all thine abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Beholde, all that vse prouerbes, shall vse this prouerbe against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Thou art thy mothers daughter, that hath cast off her husband and her children, and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which forsooke their husbands and their children: your mother is an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And thine elder sister is Samaria, and her daughters, that dwell at thy left hand, and thy yong sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom, and her daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Yet hast thou not walked after their wayes, nor done after their abominations: but as it had bene a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more then they in all thy wayes.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>As I liue, saith the Lord God, Sodom thy sister hath not done, neither shee nor her daughters, as thou hast done and thy daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Beholde, this was the iniquitie of thy sister Sodom, Pride, fulnesse of bread, and aboundance of idlenesse was in her, and in her daughters: neither did shee strengthen the hande of the poore and needie.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But they were hautie, and committed abomination before mee: therefore I tooke them away, as pleased me.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Neither hath Samaria committed halfe of thy sinnes, but thou hast exceeded them in thine abominations, and hast iustified thy sisters in all thine abominations, which thou hast done.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Therefore thou which hast iustified thy sisters, beare thine owne shame for thy sinnes, that thou hast committed more abominable then they which are more righteous then thou art: be thou therefore confounded also, and beare thy shame, seeing that thou hast iustified thy sisters.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Therefore I will bring againe their captiuitie with the captiuitie of Sodom, and her daughters, and with the captiuitie of Samaria, and her daughters: euen the captiuitie of thy captiues in the middes of them,  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>That thou mayest beare thine owne shame, and mayest bee confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou hast comforted them.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall returne to their former state: Samaria also and her daughters shall returne to their former state, when thou and thy daughters shall returne to your former state.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>For thy sister Sodom was not heard of by thy report in the day of thy pride,  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Before thy wickednes was discouered, as in that same time of the reproch of the daughters of Aram, and of all the daughters of the Philistims round about her which despise thee on all sides.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Thou hast borne therefore thy wickednesse and thine abomination, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord God, I might euen deale with thee, as thou hast done: when thou didest despise the othe, in breaking the couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, I wil remember my couenant made with thee in ye dayes of thy youth, and I wil confirme vnto thee an euerlasting couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Then thou shalt remember thy wayes, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receiue thy sisters, both thy elder and thy yonger, and I will giue them vnto thee for daughters, but not by thy couenat.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And I wil establish my couenant with thee, and thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>That thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and neuer open thy mouth any more: because of thy shame when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
