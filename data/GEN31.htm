And I answered, Lo, I am here.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he sayde, Lift vp nowe thine eyes, and see all the hee goates leaping vpon ye shee goates that are partie coloured, spotted with litle and great spots: for I haue seene all that Laban doeth vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anoyntedst the pillar, where thou vowedst a vowe vnto me. Nowe arise, get thee out of this countrey and returne vnto ye land where thou wast borne.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then answered Rahel and Leah, and sayde vnto him, Haue wee any more porcion and inheritance in our fathers house?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Doeth not he count vs as strangers? for he hath solde vs, and hath eaten vp and consumed our money.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore all the riches, which God hath taken from our father, is ours and our childrens: nowe then whatsoeuer God hath saide vnto thee, doe it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Iaakob rose vp, and set his sonnes and his wiues vpon camels.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he caried away all his flockes, and al his substance which he had gotten, to wit, his riches, which he had gotten in Padan Aram, to goe to Izhak his father vnto the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whe Laban was gone to shere his sheepe, Then Rahel stole her fathers idoles.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thus Iaakob stole away ye heart of Laban the Aramite: for he told him not that he fled.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So fled he with all that he had, and he rose vp, and passed the riuer, and set his face towarde mount Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the third day after was it told Laban, that Iaakob fled.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then he tooke his brethren with him, and followed after him seuen dayes iourney, and ouertooke him at mount Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And God came to Laban the Aramite in a dreame by night, and sayde vnto him, Take heede that thou speake not to Iaakob ought saue good.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Laban ouertooke Iaakob, and Iaakob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban also with his brethren pitched vpon mount Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Laban sayde to Iaakob, What hast thou done? thou hast euen stolen away mine heart and caried away my daughters as though they had bene taken captiues with the sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wherfore diddest thou flie so secretly and steale away from me, and diddest not tel me, that I might haue sent thee foorth with mirth and with songs, with timbrel and with harpe?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But thou hast not suffered me to kisse my sonnes and my daughters: nowe thou hast done foolishly in doing so.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I am able to do you euill: but the God of your father spake vnto me yesternight, saying, Take heed that thou speake not to Iaakob ought saue good.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Nowe though thou wentest thy way, because thou greatly longedst after thy fathers house, yet wherefore hast thou stollen my gods?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Iaakob answered, and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, and thought that thou wouldest haue taken thy daughters from me.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But with whome thou findest thy gods, let him not liue. Search thou before our brethre what I haue of thine, and take it to thee, (but Iaakob wist not that Rahel had stolen them)  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then came Laban into Iaakobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maides tentes, but founde them not. So hee went out of Leahs tent, and entred into Rahels tent.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>(Nowe Rahel had taken the idoles, and put them in the camels litter and sate downe vpon them) and Laban searched al the tent, but found them not.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then said she to her father, My Lord, be not angrie that I cannot rise vp before thee: for the custome of women is vpon me: so he searched, but found not the idoles.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The Iaakob was wroth, and chode with Laban: Iaakob also answered and sayd to Laban, What haue I trespassed? what haue I offended, that thou hast pursued after me?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Seeing thou hast searched all my stuffe, what hast thou foud of all thine houshold stuffe? put it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may iudge betweene vs both.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>This twenty yere I haue bin with thee: thine ewes and thy goates haue not cast their yong, and the rammes of thy flocke haue I not eaten.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Whatsoeuer was torne of beasts, I brought it not vnto thee, but made it good my selfe: of mine hand diddest thou require it, were it stollen by day or stollen by night.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>I was in the day consumed with heate, and with frost in the night, and my sleepe departed from mine eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Thus haue I bene twentie yeere in thine house, and serued thee fourteene yeeres for thy two daughters, and sixe yeeres for thy sheepe, and thou hast changed my wages tenne times.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the feare of Izhak had bene with me, surely thou haddest sent me away nowe emptie: but God behelde my tribulation, and the labour of mine hads, and rebuked thee yester night.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then Laban answered, and saide vnto Iaakob, These daughters are my daughters, and these sonnes are my sonnes, and these sheepe are my sheepe, and all that thou seest, is mine, and what can I doe this day vnto these my daughters, or to their sonnes which they haue borne?  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Nowe therefore come and let vs make a couenant, I and thou, which may be a witnes betweene me and thee.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then tooke Iaakob a stone, and set it vp as a pillar:  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Iaakob sayde vnto his brethren, Gather stones: who brought stones, and made an heape, and they did eate there vpon the heape.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And Laban called it Iegar-sahadutha, and Iaakob called it Galeed.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>For Laban sayd, This heape is witnesse betweene me and thee this day: therefore he called the name of it Galeed.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Also he called it Mizpah, because he said, The Lord looke betweene me and thee, when we shalbe departed one from another,  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>If thou shalt vexe my daughters, or shalt take wiues beside my daughters: there is no man with vs, beholde, God is witnesse betweene me and thee.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Moreouer Laban sayd to Iaakob, Beholde this heape, and behold the pillar, which I haue set betweene me and thee,  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>This heape shall be witnesse, and the pillar shall be witnesse, that I will not come ouer this heape to thee, and that thou shalt not passe ouer this heape and this pillar vnto me for euill.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nabor, and the God of their father be iudge betweene vs: But Iaakob sware by the feare of his father Izhak.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Then Iaakob did offer a sacrifice vpon the mount, and called his brethren to eate bread. and they did eate bread, and taried all night in the mount.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And earely in the morning Laban rose vp and kissed his sonnes and his daughters, and blessed them, and Laban departing, went vnto his place againe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
