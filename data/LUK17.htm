I trowe not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So likewise yee, when yee haue done all those things, which are commanded you, say, We are vnprofitable seruants: wee haue done that which was our duetie to doe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And so it was when he went to Hierusalem, that he passed through the middes of Samaria, and Galile.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And as hee entred into a certaine towne, there met him tenne men that were lepers, which stoode a farre off.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they lift vp their voyces and saide, Iesus, Master, haue mercie on vs.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when he saw them, he said vnto them, Goe, shewe your selues vnto the Priestes. And it came to passe, that as they went, they were clensed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then one of them, when hee sawe that hee, was healed, turned backe, and with a loude voyce praised God,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And fell downe on his face at his feete, and gaue him thankes: and he was a Samaritan.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Iesus answered, and said, Are there not tenne clensed? but where are the nine?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is none founde that returned to giue God praise, saue this stranger.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he saide vnto him, Arise, goe thy way, thy faith hath saued thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when hee was demaunded of the Pharises, when the kingdome of God shoulde come, he answered them, and said, The kingdome of God commeth not with obseruation.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Neither shall men say, Loe here, or lo there: for behold, the kingdome of God is within you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he saide vnto the disciples, The dayes will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the dayes of the Sonne of man, and ye shall not see it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then they shall say to you, Behold here, or beholde there: but goe not thither, neither follow them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For as the lightening that lighteneth out of the one part vnder heauen, shineth vnto the other part vnder heauen, so shall the Sonne of man be in his day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But first must he suffer many things, and be reprooued of this generation.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And as it was in the dayes of Noe, so shall it be in the dayes of the Sonne of man.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They ate, they dranke, they married wiues, and gaue in marriage vnto the day that Noe went into the Arke: and the flood came, and destroyed them all.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Likewise also, as it was in the dayes of Lot: they ate, they dranke, they bought, they solde, they planted, they built.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heauen, and destroyed them all.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>After these ensamples shall it be in the day when the Sonne of man is reueiled.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>At that day hee that is vpon the house, and his stuffe in ye house, let him not come downe to take it out: and he that is in the fielde likewise, let him not turne backe to that he left behinde.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Remember Lots wife.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Whosoeuer will seeke to saue his soule, shall loose it: and whosoeuer shall loose it, shall get it life.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>I tell you, in that night there shall be two in one bed: the one shalbe receiued, and the other shalbe left.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Two women shalbe grinding together: the one shalbe taken, and the other shalbe left.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Two shalbe in the fielde: one shalbe receiued, and another shalbe left.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they answered, and saide to him, Where, Lord? And he said vnto them, Wheresoeuer the body is, thither shall also the eagles bee gathered together. </div><ul class='tnav'>
