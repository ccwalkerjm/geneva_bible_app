Keep not thou silence, O God: bee not still, and cease not, O God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee, haue lifted vp the head.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They haue taken craftie counsell against thy people, and haue consulted against thy secret ones.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They haue said, Come and let vs cut them off from being a nation: and let the name of Israel be no more in remembrance.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For they haue consulted together in heart, and haue made a league against thee:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Agarims:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Gebal and Ammon, and Amalech, the Philistims with the inhabitants of Tyrus:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Asshur also is ioyned with them: they haue bene an arme to the children of Lot. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Doe thou to them as vnto the Midianites: as to Sisera and as to Iabin at the riuer of Kishon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They perished at En-dor, and were dung for the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Make them, euen their princes like Oreb and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes like Zebah and like Zalmuna.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Which haue said, Let vs take for our possession the habitations of God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O my God, make them like vnto a wheele, and as the stubble before the winde.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As the fire burneth the forest, and as the flame setteth the mountaines on fire:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraide with thy storme.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Fill their faces with shame, that they may seeke thy Name, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let them be confounded and troubled for euer: yea, let them be put to shame and perish,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>That they may knowe that thou, which art called Iehouah, art alone, euen the most High ouer all the earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
