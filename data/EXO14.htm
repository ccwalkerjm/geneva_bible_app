For the Egyptians, whome ye haue seene this day, ye shall neuer see them againe.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Lord shall fight for you: therefore hold you your peace.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Wherefore cryest thou vnto me? speake vnto the children of Israel that they go forward:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And lift thou vp thy rod, and stretche out thine hand vpon the Sea and deuide it, and let the children of Israel goe on drie ground thorow the middes of the Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I, beholde, I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, that they may follow them, and I wil get me honour vpon Pharaoh, and vpon all his host, vpon his charets, and vpon his horsemen.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I haue gotten me honour vpon Pharaoh, vpon his charets, and vpon his horsemen.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>(And the Angel of God, which went before the hoste of Israel, remoued and went behinde them: also the pillar of the cloude went from before them, and stoode behinde them,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And came betweene the campe of the Egyptians and the campe of Israel: it was both a cloude and darkenes, yet gaue it light by night, so that all the night long the one came not at the other)  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Moses stretched forth his hande vpon the Sea, and the Lord caused the sea to runne backe by a strong East winde all the night, and made the Sea dry land: for the waters were deuided.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then the children of Israel went through the middes of the Sea vpon the drie ground, and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hand, and on their left hand.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Egyptians pursued and went after them to the middes of the Sea, euen all Pharaohs horses, his charets, and his horsemen.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Nowe in the morning watche, when the Lord looked vnto the hoste of the Egyptians, out of the firie and cloudie pillar, he strooke the host of the Egyptians with feare.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For he tooke off their charet wheeles, and they draue them with much a doe: so that the Egyptians euery one sayd, I wil flee from the face of Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the Lord sayde to Moses, Stretche thine hand vpon the Sea, that the waters may returne vpon the Egyptians, vpon their charets and vpon their horsemen.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Moses stretched forth his hand vpon the Sea, and the Sea returned to his force early in the morning, and the Egyptians fled against it: but the Lord ouerthrew the Egyptians in the mids of the Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So the water returned and couered the charets and the horsemen, euen all the hoste of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them: there remained not one of them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But the children of Israel walked vpon dry land thorowe the middes of the Sea, and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hande, and on their left.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thus the Lord saued Israel the same day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel sawe the Egyptians dead vpon the Sea banke.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Israel saw the mightie power, which the Lord shewed vpon the Egyptians: so the people feared the Lord, and beleeued the Lord, and his seruant Moses. </div><ul class='tnav'>
