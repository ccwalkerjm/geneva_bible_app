And he did according to the commandement that Ioseph gaue him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And in the morning the men were sent away, they, and their asses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when they went out of the citie not farre off, Ioseph sayd to his stewarde, Vp, follow after the men: and when thou doest ouertake them, say vnto them, Wherefore haue ye rewarded euill for good?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Is that not the cuppe, wherein my Lord drinketh? and in the which he doeth deuine and prophecie? ye haue done euill in so doing.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when he ouertooke them, he sayde those wordes vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they answered him, Wherefore sayeth my lorde such wordes? God forbid that thy seruants should do such a thing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behold, the money which we found in our sackes mouthes, wee brought againe to thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steale out of thy lordes house siluer or golde?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>With whomesoeuer of thy seruants it bee found, let him dye, and we also will be my lordes bondmen.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said, Now then let it be according vnto your wordes: he with whome it is found, shall be my seruant, and ye shalbe blamelesse.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then at once euery man tooke downe his sacke to the grounde, and euery one opened his sacke.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he searched, and began at the eldest and left at the yongest: and the cuppe was found in Beniamins sacke.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then they rent their clothes, and laded euery man his asse, and went againe into the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Iudah and his brethren came to Iosephs house (for he was yet there) and they fel before him on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Ioseph sayd vnto them, What acte is this, which ye haue done? know ye not that such a man as I, can deuine and prophecie?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then sayd Iudah, What shall we say vnto my lord? what shall we speake? and howe can we iustifie our selues? God hath found out the wickednesse of thy seruants: beholde, we are seruants to my Lord, both wee, and he, with whome the cuppe is founde.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But he answered, God forbid, that I should doe so, but the man, with whome the cuppe is founde, he shalbe my seruant, and go ye in peace vnto your father.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Iudah drewe neere vnto him, and sayde, O my Lord, let thy seruant nowe speake a worde in my lordes eares, and let not thy wrath be kindled against thy seruant: for thou art euen as Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My Lord asked his seruants, saying, Haue ye a father, or a brother?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And we answered my Lord, We haue a father that is olde, and a young childe, which he begate in his age: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loueth him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now thou saidest vnto thy seruants, Bring him vnto me, that I may set mine eye vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And we answered my lord, The childe can not depart from his father: for if he leaue his father, his father would die.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then saydest thou vnto thy seruants, Except your yonger brother come downe with you, looke in my face no more.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So when we came vnto thy seruant our father, and shewed him what my lord had sayd,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And our father sayde vnto vs, Goe againe, bye vs a litle foode,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then we answered, We can not go downe: but if our yongest brother go with vs, then will we go downe: for we may not see the mans face, except our yongest brother be with vs.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then thy seruant my father sayde vnto vs, Ye knowe that my wife bare me two sonnes,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the one went out from me, and I said, Of a suretie he is torne in pieces, and I sawe him not since.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Nowe yee take this also away from me: if death take him, then yee shall bring my graye head in sorowe to the graue.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Nowe therefore, when I come to thy seruant my father, and the childe be not with vs (seeing that his life dependeth on the childes life)  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then when hee shall see that the childe is not come, he will die: so shall thy seruants bring the graye head of thy seruant our father with sorowe to the graue.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Doubtlesse thy seruant became suertie for the childe to my father, and said, If I bring him not vnto thee againe, then I will beare the blame vnto my father for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Nowe therefore, I pray thee, let me thy seruant bide for the childe, as a seruant to my Lord, and let the childe go vp with his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For how can I go vp to my father, if the childe be not with me, vnlesse I woulde see the euil that shall come on my father? </div><ul class='tnav'>
