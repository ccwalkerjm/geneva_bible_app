Hee that beleeueth, shall not make haste.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Iudgement also will I laye to the rule, and righteousnesse to the balance, and the haile shall sweepe away the vaine confidence, and the waters shall ouerflowe the secret place.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And your couenant with death shalbe disanulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand: when a scourge shall runne ouer and passe through, then shall ye be trode downe by it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When it passeth ouer, it shall take you away: for it shall passe through euery morning in the day, and in the night, and there shalbe onely feare to make you to vnderstand the hearing.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the bed is streight that it can not suffice, and the couering narowe that one can not wrappe himselfe.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the Lord shall stand as in mount Perazim: hee shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his worke, his strage worke, and bring to passe his acte, his strange acte.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nowe therefore be no mockers, least your bondes increase: for I haue heard of the Lord of hostes a consumption, euen determined vpon the whole earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Hearken ye, and heare my voyce: hearken ye, and heare my speach.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Doeth the plowe man plowe all the day, to sowe? doeth he open, and breake the clots of his ground?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When he hath made it plaine, wil he not then sowe the fitches, and sowe cummin, and cast in wheat by measure, and the appointed barly and rye in their place?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For his God doeth instruct him to haue discretion, and doeth teach him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For fitches shall not be threshed with a threshing instrument, neither shall a cart wheele be turned about vpon the cummin: but ye fitches are beaten out with a staffe, and cummin with a rod.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Bread corne when it is threshed, hee doeth not alway thresh it, neither doeth the wheele of his cart still make a noyse, neither will he breake it with the teeth thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>This also commeth from the Lord of hostes, which is wonderfull in counsell, and excellent in workes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
