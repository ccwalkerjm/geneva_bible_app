<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 32</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Nowe the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad had an exceeding great multitude of cattell: and they sawe the lande of Iazer, and the lande of Gilead, that it was an apt place for cattel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then the children of Gad, and the childre of Reuben came, and spake vnto Moses and to Eleazar the Priest, and vnto the princes of the Congregation, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The land of Ataroth, and Dibon, and Iazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Which countrey the Lord smote before the Congregation of Israel, is a lande meete for cattell, and thy seruants haue cattell:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Wherefore, said they, if we haue foud grace in thy sight, let this lande be giuen vnto thy seruants for a possession, and bring vs not ouer Iorde.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Moses said vnto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren goe to warre, and ye tary heere?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Wherefore now discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel, to goe ouer into the lande, which the Lord hath giuen them?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the lande.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For when they went vp euen vnto the riuer of Eshcol, and sawe the land: they discouraged the heart of the childre of Israel, that they woulde not goe into the lande, which the Lord had giuen them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lordes wrath was kindled the same day, and he did sweare, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>None of the men that came out of Egypt from twentie yeere olde and aboue, shall see the land for the which I sware vnto Abraham, to Izhak, and to Iaakob, because they haue not wholly followed me:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Except Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenesite, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun: for they haue constantly followed the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and made them wander in the wildernesse fourty yeeres, vntill all the generation that had done euill in the sight of the Lord were consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And behold, ye are risen vp in your fathers steade as an encrease of sinfull men, still to augment the fierce wrath of the Lord, toward Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if ye turne away from following him, he will yet againe leaue the people in the wildernesse, and ye shall destroy all this folke.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they went neere to him, and said, We will builde sheepe foldes here for our sheepe, and for our cattell, and cities for our children.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But we our selues will be readie armed to go before the children of Israel, vntill we haue brought them vnto their place: but our childre shall dwell in the defenced cities, because of the inhabitants of the lande.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>We will not returne vnto our houses, vntil the children of Israel haue inherited, euery man his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Neither wil we inherite with them beyond Iorden and on that side, because our inheritance is fallen to vs on this side Iorden Eastwarde.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Moses saide vnto them, If ye will doe this thing, and goe armed before the Lord to warre:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And will goe euery one of you in harnesse ouer Iorden before the Lord, vntill he hath cast out his enemies from his sight:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And vntill the land be subdued before the Lord, then ye shall returne and be innocent toward the Lord, and toward Israel: and this land shalbe your possession before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But if ye will not doe so, beholde, ye haue sinned against the Lord, and be sure, that your sinne will finde you out.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Builde you then cities for your children and folds for your sheepe, and do that ye haue spoke.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake vnto Moses, saying, Thy seruats will doe as my lorde commandeth:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Our childre, our wiues, our sheepe, and al our cattell shall remaine there in the cities of Gilead,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But thy seruants will goe euery one armed to warre before the Lord for to fight, as my lorde saith.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So concerning them, Moses commanded Eleazar the Priest, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said vnto them, If the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben, will go with you ouer Iorden, all armed to fight before the Lord, then when the land is subdued before you, ye shall giue the the lad of Gilead for a possessio:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But if they will not goe ouer with you armed, then they shall haue their possessions amog you in the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the Lord hath said vnto thy seruants, so will we doe.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>We will goe armed before the Lord into the lande of Canaan: that the possession of our inheritance may be to vs on this side Iorden.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So Moses gaue vnto them, euen to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to halfe the tribe of Manasseh the sonne of Ioseph, the kingdome of Sihon King of the Amorites, and the kingdome of Og King of Bashan, the lande with the cities thereof and coastes, euen the cities of the countrey round about.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Atroth, Shophan, and Iazer, and Iogbehah,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, defenced cities: also sheepe foldes.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Nebo, and Baal-meon, and turned their names, and Shibmah: and gaue other names vnto the cities which they built.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the children of Machir the sonne of Manasseh went to Gilead, and tooke it, and put out the Amorites that dwelt therein.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then Moses gaue Gilead vnto Machir the sonne of Manasseh, and he dwelt therein.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Iair the sonne of Manasseh went and tooke the small townes thereof, and called them Hauoth Iair.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Also Nobah went and tooke Kenath, with the villages thereof and called it Nobah, after his owne name. </div><ul class='tnav'>
