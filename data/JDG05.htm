Was there a shielde or speare seene among fourtie thousand of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Mine heart is set on the gouernours of Israel, and on them that are willing among the people: praise ye the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Speake ye that ride on white asses, yee that dwel by Middin, and that walke by the way.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the noyse of the archers appaised among the drawers of water: there shall they rehearse the righteousnesse of the Lord, his righteousnesse of his townes in Israel: then did the people of the Lord goe downe to the gates.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Vp Deborah, vp, arise, and sing a song: arise Barak, and leade thy captiuitie captiue, thou sonne of Abinoam.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For they that remaine, haue dominio ouer the mightie of the people: the Lord hath giuen me dominion ouer the strong.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Of Ephraim their roote arose against Amalek: and after thee, Beniamin shall fight against thy people, O Amalek: of Machir came rulers, and of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Princes of Issachar were with Deborah, and Issachar, and also Barak: he was set on his feete in the valley: for the diuisions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Why abodest thou among the sheepefolds, to heare the bleatings of the flockes? for the diuisions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Gilead abode beyonde Iorden: and why doeth Dan remayne in shippes? Asher sate on the sea shoare, and taryed in his decayed places.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the people of Zebulun and Naphtali haue ieopard their liues vnto the death in the hie places of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Kings came and fought: then fought the Kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: they receiued no gaine of money.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They fought from heauen, euen the starres in their courses fought against Sisera.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Riuer Kishon swepe them away, that ancient riuer the riuer Kishon. O my soule, thou hast marched valiantly.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then were the horsehooues broken with the oft beating together of their mightie men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Curse ye Meroz: (sayd the Angel of the Lord) curse the inhabitantes thereof, because they came not to helpe the Lord, to helpe the Lord against the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Iael the wife of Heber the Kenite shall be blessed aboue other women: blessed shall she be aboue women dwelling in tentes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He asked water, and shee gaue him milke: she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>She put her hand to the naile, and her right hand to the workemans hammer: with the hammer smote she Sisera: she smote off his head, after she had wounded, and pearsed his temples.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He bowed him downe at her feete, he fell downe, and lay still: at her feete hee bowed him downe, and fell: and when he had sunke downe, he lay there dead.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The mother of Sisera looked out at a windowe, and cryed thorowe the lattesse, Why is his charet so long a comming? why tary the wheeles of his charets?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Her wise ladies answered her, Yea. Shee answered her selfe with her owne wordes,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Haue they not gotten, and they deuide the spoyle? euery man hath a mayde or two. Sisera hath a praye of diuers coloured garmentes, a pray of sundry colours made of needle worke: of diuers colours of needle worke on both sides, for the chiefe of the spoyle.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: but they that loue him, shall be as the Sunne when he riseth in his might, and the lande had rest fourtie yeres. </div><ul class='tnav'>
