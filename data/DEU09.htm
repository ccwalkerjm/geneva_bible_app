<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Heare O Israel, Thou shalt passe ouer Iorden this day, to goe in and to possesse nations greater and mightier then thy selfe, and cities great and walled vp to heauen,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>A people great and tall, euen the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Vnderstand therefore that this day ye Lord thy God is he which goeth ouer before thee as a consuming fire: he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them downe before thy face: so thou shalt cast them out and destroy them suddenly, as the Lord hath said vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Speake not thou in thine heart (after that the Lord thy God hath cast them out before thee) saying, For my righteousnesse the Lord hath brought me in, to possesse this land: but for the wickednesse of these nations the Lord hath cast them out before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For thou entrest not to inherite their lande for thy righteousnesse, or for thy vpright heart: but for the wickednesse of those nations, the Lord thy God doth cast them out before thee, and that he might performe the worde which the Lord thy God sware vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Iacob.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Vnderstand therefore, that ye Lord thy God giueth thee not this good land to possesse it for thy righteousnes: for thou art a stifnecked people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Remember, and forget not, howe thou prouokedst the Lord thy God to anger in the wildernesse: since the day that thou diddest depart out of the land of Egypt, vntill ye came vnto this place ye haue rebelled against the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Also in Horeb ye prouoked the Lord to anger so that the Lord was wroth with you, euen to destroy you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When I was gone vp into the mount, to receiue the tables of stone, the tables, I say, of the couenant, which the Lord made with you: and I abode in the mount fourtie daies and fourtie nights, and I neither ate bread nor yet dranke water:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the Lord deliuered me two tables of stone, written with the finger of God, and in them was conteyned according to all the wordes which the Lord had said vnto you in the mount out of the middes of the fire, in the day of the assemblie.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when the fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes were ended, the Lord gaue me the two tables of stone, the tables, I say, of the couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord said vnto me, Arise, get thee downe quickly from hence: for thy people which thou hast brought out of Egypt, haue corrupt their wayes: they are soone turned out of the way, which I commanded them: they haue made them a molten image.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Furthermore, the Lord spake vnto me, saying, I haue seene this people, and beholde, it is a stifnecked people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and put out their name from vnder heaue, and I wil make of thee a mightie nation, and greater then they be.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So I returned, and came downe from the Mount (and the Mount burnt with fire, and ye two Tables of the couenant were in my two handes)  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then I looked, and beholde, ye had sinned against the Lord your God: for ye had made you a molten calfe, and had turned quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore I tooke the two Tables, and cast them out of my two handes, and brake them before your eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I fell downe before the Lord, fourtie dayes, and fourtie nightes, as before: I neither ate bread nor dranke water, because of al your sinnes, which ye had committed, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, in that ye prouoked him vnto wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>(For I was afraide of the wrath and indignation, wherewith the Lord was mooued against you, euen to destroy you) yet the Lord heard me at that time also.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Likewise ye Lord was very angrie with Aaron, euen to destroy him: but at that time I prayed also for Aaron.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I tooke your sinne, I meane the calfe which ye had made, and burnt him with fire, and stamped him and ground him small, euen vnto very dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the riuer, that descended out of the mount.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Also in Taberah, and in Massah and in Kibrothhattaauah ye prouoked ye Lord to anger.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Goe vp, and possesse the land which I haue giuen you, then ye rebelled against the commandement of the Lord your God, and beleeued him not, nor hearkened vnto his voyce.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ye haue bene rebellious vnto the Lord, since the day that I knewe you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then I fell downe before ye Lord fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes, as I fell downe before, because ye Lord had said, that he woulde destroy you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I prayed vnto the Lord, and saide, O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatnesse, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt by a mightie hand.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Remember thy seruants Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob: looke not to ye stubburnes of this people, nor to their wickednes, nor to their sinne,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Lest the countrey, whence thou broughtest them, say, Because ye Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, or because he hated them, he caried them out, to slay them in the wildernesse.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Yet they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mightie power, and by thy stretched out arme. </div><ul class='tnav'>
