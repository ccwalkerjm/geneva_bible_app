(and the Canaanites and the Perizzites dwelled at that time in the land.)  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then saide Abram vnto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, betweene thee and me, neither betweene mine heardmen and thine heardmen: for we be brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Is not the whole land before thee? depart I pray thee from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will goe to the right: or if thou goe to the right hand, then I will take the left.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So when Lot lifted vp his eyes, he saw that all the plaine of Iorden was watered euery where: (for before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorah, it was as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest vnto Zoar)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Lot chose vnto him all the plaine of Iorden, and tooke his iourney from the East: and they departed the one from the other.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Abram dwelled in the lande of Canaan, and Lot abode in the cities of the plaine, and pitched his tent euen to Sodom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now the men of Sodom were wicked and exceeding sinners against the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the Lord saide vnto Abram, (after that Lot was departed from him) Lift vp thine eyes nowe, and looke from the place where thou art, Northward, and Southward, and Eastwarde, and Westward:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For all the land, which thou seest, will I giue vnto thee and to thy seede for euer,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will make thy seede, as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seede be numbred.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Arise, walke through the land, in ye length thereof, and breadth thereof: for I will giue it vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Abram remoued his tent, and came and dwelled in the plaine of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and builded there an altar vnto ye Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
