And Michal answered Saul, He said vnto me, Let me go, or els I will kill thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So Dauid fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him: and he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But one tolde Saul, saying, Beholde, Dauid is at Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Saul sent messengers to take Dauid: and when they sawe a company of Prophets prophecying, and Samuel standing as appoynted ouer them, the Spirit of God fell vpon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophecied.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when it was tolde Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophecied likewise: againe Saul sent the third messengers, and they prophecied also.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then went he himselfe to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu, and he asked, and sayd, Where are Samuel and Dauid? and one sayd, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he went thither, euen to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God came vpon him also, and he went prophecying vntill hee came to Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he stript off his clothes, and he prophesied also before Samuel, and fell downe naked all that day and all that night: therefore they say, Is Saul also among the Prophets? </div><ul class='tnav'>
