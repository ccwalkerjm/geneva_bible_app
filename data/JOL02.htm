Wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then will the Lord be ielous ouer his land, and spare his people.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yea, the Lord wil answere and say vnto his people, Beholde, I will send you corne, and wine, and oyle, and you shalbe satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproche among the heathen,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But I will remooue farre off from you the Northren armie, and I will driue him into a land, barren and desolate with his face toward the East sea, and his end to the vtmost sea, and his stinke shall come vp, and his corruption shall ascend, because he hath exalted himselfe to do this.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Feare not, O land, but be glad, and reioyce: for the Lord wil do great things.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Be not afrayde, ye beastes of the fielde: for the pastures of the wildernesse are greene: for the tree beareth her fruite: the figge tree and the vine do giue their force.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and reioyce in the Lord your God: for he hath giuen you the rayne of righteousnes, he wil cause to come downe for you the rayne, euen the first raine, and the latter raine in the first moneth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the barnes shalbe full of wheate, and the presses shall abound with wine and oyle.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will render you the yeeres that the grashopper hath eaten, the canker worme and the caterpiller and the palmer worme, my great hoste which I sent among you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So you shall eate and be satisfied and praise the Name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt marueilously with you: and my people shall neuer be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Ye shall also know, that I am in the middes of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God and none other, and my people shall neuer be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And afterward will I powre out my Spirit vpon all flesh: and your sonnes and your daughters shall prophecie: your olde men shall dreame dreames, and your yong men shall see visions,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And also vpon the seruants, and vpon the maydes in those dayes wil I powre my Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And I will shewe wonders in the heauens and in the earth: blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The sunne shalbe turned into darkenesse, and the moone into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But whosoeuer shall call on the Name of the Lord, shalbe saued: for in mount Zion, and in Ierusale shalbe deliuerance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant, whom the Lord shall call. </div><ul class='tnav'>
