Is the Lawe sinne? God forbid. Nay, I knewe not sinne, but by the Lawe: for I had not knowen lust, except the Lawe had sayd, Thou shalt not lust.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But sinne tooke an occasion by ye commandement, and wrought in me all maner of concupiscence: for without the Lawe sinne is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For I once was aliue, without the Law: but when the commandement came, sinne reuiued,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But I died: and the same commandement which was ordeined vnto life, was found to be vnto me vnto death.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For sinne tooke occasion by the commandement, and deceiued me, and thereby slewe me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wherefore the Lawe is holy, and that commandement is holy, and iust, and good.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Was that then which is good, made death vnto me? God forbid: but sinne, that it might appeare sinne, wrought death in me by that which is good, that sinne might be out of measure sinfull by the commandement.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we knowe that the Law is spirituall, but I am carnall, solde vnder sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I alow not that which I do: for what I would, that do I not: but what I hate, that do I.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If I doe then that which I woulde not, I consent to the Lawe, that it is good.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Nowe then, it is no more I, that doe it, but sinne that dwelleth in me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I know, that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to wil is preset with me: but I find no meanes to perform that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I doe not the good thing, which I would, but the euil, which I would not, that do I.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Nowe if I do that I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but the sinne that dwelleth in me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I finde then that when I would doe good, I am thus yoked, that euill is present with me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For I delite in the Law of God, concerning the inner man:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But I see another Law in my members, rebelling against the Lawe of my minde, and leading me captiue vnto the lawe of sinne, which is in my members.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the body of this death!  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I thanke God through Iesus Christ our Lord. Then I my selfe in my minde serue the Lawe of God, but in my flesh the lawe of sinne. </div><ul class='tnav'>
