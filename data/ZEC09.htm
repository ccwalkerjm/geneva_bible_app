I haue loosed thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Turne you to the strong holde, ye prisoners of hope: euen to day doe I declare, that I will render the double vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For Iudah haue I bent as a bowe for me: Ephraims hand haue I filled, and I haue raised vp thy sonnes, O Zion, against thy sonnes, O Grecia, and haue made thee as a gyants sword.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord shalbe seene ouer them, and his arrowe shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blowe the trumpet, and shall come forth with the whirlewindes of the South.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Lord of hostes shall defend them, and they shall deuoure them, and subdue them with sling stones, and they shall drinke, and make a noyse as thorowe wine, and they shalbe filled like bowles, and as the hornes of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord their God shall deliuer them in that day as the flocke of his people: for they shall be as the stones of the crowne lifted up upon his land.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For howe great is his goodnesse! and howe great is his beautie! corne shall make the yong men cherefull, and newe wine the maides. </div><ul class='tnav'>
