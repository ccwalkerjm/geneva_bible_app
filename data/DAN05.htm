And the King spake, and sayd to the wise men of Babel, Whosoeuer can reade this writing, and declare me the interpretation thereof, shalbe clothed with purple, and shall haue a chaine of golde about his necke, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then came all the Kings wise men, but they could neither reade the writing, nor shewe the King the interpretation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his princes were astonied.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now the Queene by reason of the talke of the King, and his princes came into the banket house, and the Queene spake, and sayd, O King, liue for euer: let not thy thoughtes trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is a man in thy kingdome, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and in the dayes of thy father light and vnderstanding and wisdome like the wisdome of the gods, was found in him: whom the King Nebuchad-nezzar thy father, the King, I say, thy father, made chiefe of the enchanters, astrologians, Caldeans, and soothsayers,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Because a more excellent spirit, and knowledge, and vnderstanding (for hee did expound dreames, and declare hard sentences, and dissolued doubtes) were founde in him, euen in Daniel, whome the King named Belteshazzar: nowe let Daniel be called, and hee will declare the interpretation.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then was Daniel brought before the King, and the King spake and sayd vnto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captiuitie of Iudah, whom my father the King brought out of Iewrie?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now I haue heard of thee, that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and that light and vnderstanding and excellent wisdome is found in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now therefore, wisemen and astrologians haue bene brought before me, that they should reade this writing, and shewe me the interpretation thereof: but they could not declare the interpretation of the thing.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then heard I of thee, that thou couldest shewe interpretations, and dissolue doutes: nowe if thou canst reade the writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and shalt haue a chaine of golde about thy necke, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Daniel answered, and sayd before the King, Keepe thy rewards to thy selfe, and giue thy giftes to another: yet I will reade the writing vnto the King, and shew him the interpretation.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>O King, heare thou, The most high God gaue vnto Nebuchad-nezzar thy father a kingdome, and maiestie, and honour and glory.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And for the maiestie that he gaue him, all people, nations, and languages trembled, and feared before him: he put to death whom he would: he smote whome he would: whome he would he set vp, and whome he would he put downe.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But when his heart was puft vp, and his minde hardened in pride, hee was deposed from his kingly throne, and they tooke his honour from him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And hee was driuen from the sonnes of men, and his heart was made like the beastes, and his dwelling was with the wilde asses: they fed him with grasse like oxen, and his body was wet with the dewe of the heauen, till he knewe, that the most high God bare rule ouer the kingdome of men, and that he appointeth ouer it, whomsoeuer he pleaseth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And thou his sonne, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all these things,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But hast lift thy selfe vp against the Lord of heauen, and they haue brought the vessels of his House before thee, and thou and thy princes, thy wiues and thy concubines haue drunke wine in them, and thou hast praysed the gods of siluer and golde, of brasse, yron, wood and stone, which neither see, neither heare, nor vnderstand: and the God in whose hand thy breath is and all thy wayes, him hast thou not glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then was the palme of the hand sent from him, and hath written this writing.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And this is the writing that he hath written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>This is the interpretation of the thing, MENE, God hath nombred thy kingdome, and hath finished it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>TEKEL, thou art wayed in the balance, and art found too light.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>PERES, thy kingdome is deuided, and giuen to the Medes and Persians.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then at the commandement of Belshazzar they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chaine of golde about his necke, and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The same night was Belshazzar the King of the Caldeans slaine.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Darius of the Medes tooke the kingdome, being threescore and two yeere olde. </div><ul class='tnav'>
