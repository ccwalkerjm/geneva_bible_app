<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 33</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Moreover, the worde of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah the second time (while he was yet shut vp in the court of prison) saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord, the maker thereof, the Lord that formed it, and established it, the Lord is his Name.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Call vnto me, and I will answere thee, and shewe thee great and mightie things, which thou knowest not.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, concerning the houses of this citie, and concerning the houses of the Kings of Iudah, which are destroyed by the mounts, and by the sword,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They come to fight with the Caldeans, but it is to fill themselues with the dead bodies of men, whome I haue slaine in mine anger and in my wrath: for I haue hid my face from this citie, because of all their wickednes.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold, I will giue it health and amendment: for I wil cure them, and will reueile vnto them the abundance of peace, and trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I wil cause the captiuitie of Iudah and the captiuitie of Israel to returne, and will build them as at the first.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I wil clense them from all their iniquitie, whereby they haue sinned against me: yea, I wil pardon all their iniquities, whereby they haue sinned against me, and whereby they haue rebelled against me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it shalbe to me a name, a ioy, a praise, and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall heare all ye good that I doe vnto them: and they shall feare and tremble for all the goodnes, and for all the wealth, that I shew vnto this citie.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord, Againe there shalbe heard in this place (which ye say shalbe desolate, without man, and without beast, euen in the cities of Iudah, and in the streetes of Ierusalem, that are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The voyce of ioy and the voyce of gladnes, the voyce of the bridegrome, and the voyce of the bride, the voyce of them that shall say, Prayse the Lord of hostes, because the Lord is good: for his mercy endureth for euer, and of them that offer the sacrifice of prayse in the House of the Lord, for I will cause to returne the captiuitie of the land, as at the first, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, Againe in this place, which is desolate, without man, and without beast, and in all the cities thereof there shall be dwelling for shepheards to rest their flockes.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In the cities of the mountaines, in the cities in the plaine, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Beniamin, and about Ierusalem, and in the cities of Iudah shall the sheepe passe againe, vnder the hand of him that telleth them, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Beholde, the dayes come, sayth the Lord, that I wil performe that good thing, which I haue promised vnto the house of Israel, and to the house of Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>In those dayes and at that time, wil I cause the branch of righteousnesse to growe vp vnto Dauid, and he shall execute iudgement, and righteousnes in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In those dayes shall Iudah be saued, and Ierusalem shall dwell safely, and hee that shall call her, is the Lord our righteousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thus sayth the Lord, Dauid shall neuer want a man to sit vpon the throne of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Neither shall the Priests and Leuites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to offer meat offerings, and to doe sacrifice continually.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the worde of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord, If you can breake my couenant of the day, and my couenant of the night, that there should not be day, and night in their season,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then may my couenant be broken with Dauid my seruant, that he should not haue a sonne to reigne vpon his throne, and with the Leuites, and Priests my ministers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>As the army of heauen can not be nombred, neither the sand of the sea measured: so wil I multiplie the seede of Dauid my seruant, and the Leuites, that minister vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came to Ieremiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Considerest thou not what this people haue spoken, saying, The two families, which the Lord hath chosen, hee hath euen cast them off? thus they haue despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord, If my couenant be not with day and night, and if I haue not appointed the order of heauen and earth,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then will I cast away the seede of Iaakob and Dauid my seruant, and not take of his seede to be rulers ouer the seede of Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob: for I wil cause their captiuitie to returne, and haue compassion on them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
