And from the wildernesse they came to Mattanah,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the plaine of Moab, to the top of Pisgah that looketh toward Ieshimon.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon, King of the Amorites, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let me goe through thy land: we wil not turne aside into the fieldes, nor into the vineyardes, neither drinke of the waters of ye welles: we will goe by the kings way, vntill we be past thy countrey.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But Sihon gaue Israel no licence to passe through his countrey, but Sihon assembled all his people, and went out against Israel into the wildernesse: and he came to Iahoz, and fought against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and conquered his land, from Arnon vnto Iabok, euen vnto ye children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Israel tooke al these cities, and dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all the villages thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For Heshbon was the citie of Sihon the king of the Amorites, which had fought beforetime against the king of the Moabites, and had taken al his land out of his hand, euen vnto Arnon.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wherefore they that speake in prouerbes, say, Come to Heshbon, let the citie of Sihon bee built and repaired:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, and a flame from the citie of Sihon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the lords of Bamoth in Arnon.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Wo be to thee, Moab: O people of Chemosh, thou art vndone: he hath suffered his sonnes to be pursued, and his daughters to be in captiuitie to Sihon the king of the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Their empire also is lost from Heshbon vnto Dibon, and wee haue destroyed them vnto Nophah, which reacheth vnto Medeba.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Thus Israel dwelt in the lande of the Amorites.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Moses sent to searche out Iaazer, and they tooke the townes belonging thereto, and rooted out the Amorites that were there.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they turned and went vp toward Bashan: and Og the King of Bashan came out against them, hee, and all his people, to fight at Edrei.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Feare him not: for I haue deliuered him into thine hand and all his people, and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou diddest vnto Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>They smote him therefore, and his sonnes, and all his people, vntill there was none left him: so they conquered his land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
