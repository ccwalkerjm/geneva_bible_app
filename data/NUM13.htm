And be of good courage, and bring of the fruite of the lande (for then was the time of the first ripe grapes)  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So they went vp, and searched out the lande, from the wildernesse of Zin vnto Rehob, to go to Hamath,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they ascended toward the South, and came vnto Hebron, where were Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the sonnes of Anak. And Hebron was built seuen yeere before Zoan in Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then they came to the riuer of Eshcol, and cut downe thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it vpon a barre betweene two, and brought of the pomegranates and of the figges.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>That place was called the riuer Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes, which the children of Israel cut downe thence.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then after fourtie dayes, they turned againe from searching of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and vnto al the Congregation of the children of Israel, in the wildernesse of Paran, to Kadesh, and brought to the, and to all the Congregation tydings, and shewed them the fruite of the lande.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they tolde him, and saide, We came vnto the land whither thou hast sent vs, and surely it floweth with milke and honie: and here is of the fruite of it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and exceeding great: and moreouer, we sawe the sonnes of Anak there.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The Amalekites dwell in the South countrey, and the Hittites, and the Iebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountaines, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Iorden.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and saide, Let vs go vp at once, and possesse it: for vndoubtedly we shall ouercome it.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But the men, that went vp with him, saide, we be not able to goe vp against the people: for they are stronger then we.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So they brought vp an euill report of the land which they had searched for the children of Israel, saying, The lande which we haue gone through to search it out, is a land that eateth vp the inhabitants thereof: for all the people that we sawe in it, are men of great stature.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For there we sawe gyants, the sonnes of Anak, which come of the gyants, so that we seemed in our sight like grashoppers: and so wee were in their sight. </div><ul class='tnav'>
