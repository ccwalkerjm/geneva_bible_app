Heare the right, O Lord, consider my crye: hearken vnto my prayer of lips vnfained.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Let my sentence come forth from thy presence, and let thine eyes beholde equitie.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Thou hast prooued and visited mine heart in the night: thou hast tryed me, and foundest nothing: for I was purposed that my mouth should not offend.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Concerning the workes of men, by the wordes of thy lips I kept mee from the paths of the cruell man.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Stay my steps in thy paths, that my feete doe not slide.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I haue called vpon thee: surely thou wilt heare me, O God: incline thine eare to me, and hearken vnto my wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Shewe thy marueilous mercies, thou that art the Sauiour of them that trust in thee, from such as resist thy right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Keepe me as the apple of the eye: hide me vnder the shadowe of thy wings,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>From the wicked that oppresse mee, from mine enemies, which compasse me round about for my soule.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They are inclosed in their owne fat, and they haue spoken proudely with their mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They haue compassed vs now in our steps: they haue set their eyes to bring downe to the ground:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Like as a lyon that is greedy of pray, and as it were a lyons whelp lurking in secret places.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Vp Lord, disappoint him: cast him downe: deliuer my soule from the wicked with thy sworde,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>From men by thine hand, O Lord, from men of the world, who haue their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thine hid treasure: their children haue ynough, and leaue the rest of their substance for their children.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But I will beholde thy face in righteousnes, and when I awake, I shalbe satisfied with thine image. </div><ul class='tnav'>
