howe is Babel become desolate among the nations!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I haue snared thee, and thou art taken, O Babel, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striuen against the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The Lord hath opened his treasure, and hath brought foorth the weapons of his wrath: for this is the woorke of the Lord God of hostes in the lande of the Caldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Come against her from the vtmost border: open her store houses: treade on her as on sheaues, and destroy her vtterly: let nothing of her be left.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Destroy all her bullockes: let them goe downe to the slaughter. Wo vnto them, for their day is come, and the time of their visitation.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The voyce of them that flee, and escape out of the lande of Babel to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, and the vengeance of his Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Call vp the archers against Babel: al ye that bend the bow, besiege it rounde about: let none thereof escape: recompence her according to her worke, and according to all that she hath done, doe vnto her: for she hath bene proud against the Lord, euen against the holy one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore shall her yong men fall in the streetes, and al her men of warre shalbe destroied in that day, sayeth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Beholde, I come vnto thee, O proude man, saith the Lord God of hostes: for thy day is come, euen the time that I will visite thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the proude shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him vp: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall deuoure all round about him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Thus saieth the Lord of hosts, The children of Israel, and the children of Iudah were oppressed together: and all that tooke them captiues, held them, and would not let them goe.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But their strong redeemer, whose Name is the Lord of hostes, he shall maintaine their cause, that he may giue rest to the lande, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>A sworde is vpon the Caldeans, sayeth the Lord, and vpon the inhabitants of Babel, and vpon her princes, and vpon her wise men.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>A sworde is vpon the soothsaiers, and they shall dote: a sword is vpon her strong men, and they shalbe afraide.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>A sworde is vpon their horses and vpon their charets, and vpon all the multitude that are in the middes of her, and they shall be like women: a sworde is vpon her treasures, and they shall be spoyled.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>A drought is vpon her waters, and they shall be dried vp: for it is the lande of grauen images, and they dote vpon their idoles.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Therefore the Ziims with the Iims shall dwel there, and the ostriches shall dwel therein: for it shall be no more inhabited, neither shall it be inhabited from generation vnto generation.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>As God destroied Sodom and Gomorah with the places thereof neere about, sayeth the Lord: so shall no man dwell theere, neither shall the sonne of man remaine therein.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Beholde, a people shall come from the North, and a great nation, and many Kings shall be raised vp from the coastes of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They shall holde the bowe and the buckeler: they are cruell and vnmercifull: their voyce shall roare like the sea, and they shall ride vpon horses, and be put in aray like men to the battell against thee, O daughter of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>The King of Babel hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: sorow came vpon him, euen sorowe as of a woman in trauaile.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Beholde, hee shall come vp like a lyon from the swelling of Iorden vnto the strong habitation: for I will make Israel to rest, and I will make them to haste away from her: and who is a chosen man that I may appoynt against her? for who is like me, and who will appoynt me the time? and who is the shepheard that will stande before me?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Therefore heare the counsell of the Lord that hee hath deuised against Babel, and his purpose that hee hath conceiued against the lande of the Caldeans: surely the least of the flocke shall drawe them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>At the noyse of the winning of Babel the earth is moued, and the crye is heard among the nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
