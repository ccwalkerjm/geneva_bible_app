 <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And on the morow the people rose vp and made there an altar, and offred burnt offrings and peace offrings.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the children of Israel said, Who is he among all the tribes of Israel, that came not vp with the Congregation vnto the Lord? for they had made a great othe concerning him that came not vp to the Lord to Mizpeh, saying, Let him die the death.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the children of Israel were sory for Beniamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>How shall we do for wiues to them that remaine, seeing we haue sworne by the Lord, that we will not giue them of our daughters to wiues?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Also they saide, Is there any of the tribes of Israel that came not vp to Mizpeh to the Lord? and beholde, there came none of Iabesh Gilead vnto the hoste and to the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For when the people were vewed; beholde, none of the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead were there.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore the Congregation sent thither twelue thousande men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Goe, and smite the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, both women, and children.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And this is it that ye shall do: ye shall vtterly destroye all the males and all the women that haue lien by men.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they found among the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead foure hundreth maides, virgins that had knowne no man by lying with any male: and they brought them vnto the hoste to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the whole Congregation sent and spake with the children of Beniamin that were in the rocke of Rimmon, and called peaceably vnto them:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Beniamin came againe at that time, and they gaue them wiues which they had saued aliue of the women of Iabesh Gilead: but they had not so ynough for them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the people were sorie for Beniamin, because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore the Elders of the Congregation said, How shall we doe for wiues to the remnant? for the women of Beniamin are destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they saide, there must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Beniamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Howbeit we may not giue them wiues of our daughters: for the childre of Israel had sworne, saying, Cursed be he that giueth a wise to Beniamin.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore they said, Beholde, there is a feast of the Lord euery yere in Shiloh in a place, which is on the Northside of Beth-el, and on the Eastside of the way that goeth vp from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the South of Lebonah.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore they commanded the children of Beniamin, saying, Goe, and lye in waite in the vineyardes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when ye see that the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catche you euery man a wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and goe into the land of Beniamin.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when their fathers or their brethren come vnto vs to complaine, we wil say vnto them, Haue pitie on them for our sakes, because we reserued not to eche man his wife in the warre, and because ye haue not giuen vnto them hitherto, ye haue sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the children of Beniamin did so, and tooke wiues of them that danced according to their nomber: which they tooke, and went away, and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities and dwelt in them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So the children of Israel departed thence at that time, euery man to his tribe, and to his familie, and went out from thence euery man to his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In those dayes there was no King in Israel, but euery man did that which was good in his eyes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
