<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Therefore thou shalt loue the Lord thy God, and shalt keepe that, which he commandeth to be kept: that is, his ordinances, and his lawes, and his commandements alway.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And consider this day (for I speake not to your children, which haue neither knowen nor seene) the chastisement of the Lord your God, his greatnesse, his mighty hande, and his stretched out arme,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And his signes, and his actes, which hee did in the middes of Egypt vnto Pharaoh the King of Egypt and vnto all his land:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And what he did vnto the hoste of the Egyptians, vnto their horses, and to their charets, when he caused the waters of the red Sea to ouerflowe them, as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroied them vnto this day:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And what he did vnto you in the wildernesse, vntill yee came vnto this place:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And what he did vnto Dathan and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab ye sonne of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them with their housholds and their tents, and all their substance that they had in the middes of al Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For your eyes haue seene all the great actes of the Lord which he did.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore shall ye keepe all the commandements, which I commaund you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possesse the land whither ye goe to possesse it:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Also that ye may prolong your daies in the land, which the Lord sware vnto your fathers, to giue vnto them and to their seede, euen a lande that floweth with milke and honie.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the land whither thou goest to possesse it, is not as the lande of Egypt, from whence ye came, where thou sowedst thy seede, and wateredst it with thy feete as a garden of herbes:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the land whither ye goe to possesse it, is a land of mountaines and valleis, and drinketh water of the raine of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This land doth the Lord thy God care for: the eies of the Lord thy God are alwaies vpon it, from the beginning of the yeere, euen vnto the ende of the yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If yee shall hearken therefore vnto my commandements, which I commaund you this day, that yee loue the Lord your God and serue him with all your heart, and with all your soule,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I also wil giue raine vnto your land in due time, the first raine and the latter, that thou maist gather in thy wheat, and thy wine, and thine oyle.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Also I will send grasse in thy fieldes, for thy cattel, that thou maist eate, and haue inough.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But beware lest your heart deceiue you, and lest yee turne aside, and serue other gods, and worship them,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And so the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut vp the heauen, that there be no raine, and that your lande yeelde not her fruit, and yee perish quickly from the good land, which the Lord giueth you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore shall ye lay vp these my words in your heart and in your soule, and binde them for a signe vpon your hand, that they may be as a frontlet betweene your eyes,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them, whe thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest downe, and when thou risest vp.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou shalt write them vpon the postes of thine house, and vpon thy gates,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That your daies may be multiplied, and the daies of your children, in ye land which the Lord sware vnto your fathers to giue them, as long as the heauens are aboue the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For if ye keepe diligently all these commandements, which I command you to doe: that is, to loue the Lord your God, to walke in all his waies, and to cleaue vnto him,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then will the Lord cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall possesse great nations and mightier then you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>All the places whereon the soles of your feete shall tread, shalbe yours: your coast shalbe from the wildernes and from Lebanon, and from the Riuer, euen the riuer Perath, vnto ye vttermost Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>No man shall stande against you: for the Lord your God shall cast the feare and dread of you vpon all the land that ye shall treade vpon, as he hath said vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Beholde, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The blessing, if ye obey the commandements of the Lord your God which I command you this day:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And ye curse, if ye wil not obey the commandements of the Lord your God, but turne out of the way, which I commande you this day, to go after other gods, which ye haue not knowen.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When the Lord thy God therefore hath brought thee into ye lande, whither thou goest to possesse it, then thou shalt put the blessing vpon mount Gerizim, and the curse vpon mount Ebal.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Are they not beyond Iorden on that part, where the sunne goeth downe in the land of the Canaanites, which dwel in the plaine ouer against Gilgal, beside the groue of Moreh?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For yee shall passe ouer Iorden, to goe in to possesse the land, which ye Lord your God giueth you, and ye shall possesse it, and dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Take heede therefore that ye doe all the commandements and the lawes, which I set before you this day. </div><ul
