 <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Nowe therefore heare me, and deliuer the captiues againe, which ye haue taken prisoners of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the Lord is toward you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wherefore certaine of the chiefe of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the sonne of Iehohanan, Berechiah the sonne of Meshillemoth, and Iehizkiah the sonne of Shallum, and Amasa the sonne of Hadlai, stood vp against them that came from the warre,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And said vnto them, Bring not in the captiues hither: for this shalbe a sinne vpon vs against the Lord: ye entende to adde more to our sinnes and to our trespasse, though our trespasse be great, and the fierce wrath of God is against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the armie left the captiues and the spoyle before the princes and all the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the men that were named by name, rose vp and tooke the prisoners, and with the spoyle clothed all that were naked among them, and arayed them, and shod them, and gaue them meate, and gaue them drinke, and anoynted them, and caryed all that were feeble of them vpon asses, and brought them to Iericho the citie of Palme trees to their brethren: so they returned to Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At that time did King Ahaz sende vnto the Kings of Asshur, to helpe him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>(For the Edomites came moreouer, and slew of Iudah, and caryed away captiues.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Philistims also inuaded the cities in the low countrey, and toward the South of Iudah, and tooke Bethshemesh, and Aialon, and Gederoth and Shocho, with the villages thereof, and Timnah, with her villages, and Gimzo, with her villages, and they dwelt there.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the Lord had humbled Iudah, because of Ahaz King of Israel: for he had brought vengeance vpon Iudah, and had grieuously transgressed against the Lord)  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Tilgath Pilneeser king of Asshur came vnto him, who troubled him and did not strengthen him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For Ahaz tooke a portion out of the house of the Lord and out of the Kings house and of the Princes, and gaue vnto the king of Asshur: yet it helped him not.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And in ye time of his tribulation did he yet trespasse more against ye Lord, (this is King Ahaz)  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For he sacrificed vnto the gods of Damascus, which plagued him, and he sayd, Because the gods of the Kings of Aram helped them, I wil sacrifice vnto them, and they will helpe me: yet they were his ruine, and of all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Ahaz gathered the vessels of ye house of God, and brake the vessels of the house of God, and shut vp the doores of the house of the Lord, and made him altars in euery corner of Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And in euery citie of Iudah hee made hie places, to burne incense vnto other gods, and prouoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Concerning the rest of his actes, and all his wayes first and last, beholde, they are written in the booke of the Kings of Iudah, and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the citie of Ierusalem, but brought him not vnto the sepulchres of the Kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his sonne reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
