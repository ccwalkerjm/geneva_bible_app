O Lord, heare my prayer, and let my crye come vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine eares vnto me: when I call, make haste to heare me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For my dayes are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burnt like an herthe.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Mine heart is smitten and withereth like grasse, because I forgate to eate my bread.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For the voyce of my groning my bones doe cleaue to my skinne.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I am like a pelicane of the wildernesse: I am like an owle of the deserts.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I watch and am as a sparrowe alone vpon the house top.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Mine enemies reuile me dayly, and they that rage against me, haue sworne against me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Surely I haue eaten asshes as bread, and mingled my drinke with weeping,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast heaued me vp, and cast me downe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>My dayes are like a shadowe that fadeth, and I am withered like grasse.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But thou, O Lord, doest remaine for euer, and thy remembrance from generation to generation.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou wilt arise and haue mercy vpon Zion: for the time to haue mercie thereon, for the appointed time is come.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For thy seruants delite in the stones thereof, and haue pitie on the dust thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the heathen shall feare the Name of the Lord, and all the Kings of the earth thy glory,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When the Lord shall build vp Zion, and shall appeare in his glory,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And shall turne vnto the prayer of the desolate, and not despise their prayer.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people, which shalbe created, shall prayse the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For he hath looked downe from the height of his Sanctuarie: out of the heauen did the Lord beholde the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>That he might heare the mourning of the prisoner, and deliuer the children of death:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Zion, and his prayse in Ierusalem,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When the people shalbe gathered together, and the kingdomes to serue the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He abated my strength in the way, and shortened my dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I sayd, O my God, take me not away in the middes of my dayes: thy yeeres endure from generation to generation.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thou hast aforetime layde the foundation of the earth, and the heauens are the worke of thine hands.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: euen they all shall waxe olde as doeth a garment: as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But thou art the same, and thy yeeres shall not fayle.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The children of thy seruants shall continue, and their seede shall stand fast in thy sight. </div><ul class='tnav'>
