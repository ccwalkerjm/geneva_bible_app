If any man sinne not in word, he is a perfect man, and able to bridle all the body.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Beholde, we put bittes into the horses mouthes, that they should obey vs, and we turne about all their bodie.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Behold also the shippes, which though they be so great, and are driuen of fierce windes, yet are they turned about with a very small rudder, whither soeuer the gouernour listeth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Euen so the tongue is a litle member, and boasteth of great things: beholde, howe great a thing a litle fire kindleth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the tongue is fire, yea, a worlde of wickednesse: so is the tongue set among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature, and it is set on fire of hell.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the whole nature of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and things of the sea is tamed, and hath bene tamed of the nature of man.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the tongue can no man tame. It is an vnruly euill, full of deadly poyson.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therewith blesse we God euen the Father, and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Out of one mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing: my brethren, these things ought not so to be.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Doeth a fountaine send forth at one place sweete water and bitter?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Can ye figge tree, my brethren, bring forth oliues, either a vine figges? so can no fountaine make both salt water and sweete.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew by good conuersation his workes in meekenesse of wisdome.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But if ye haue bitter enuying and strife in your hearts, reioyce not, neither be liars against the trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>This wisedome descendeth not from aboue, but is earthly, sensuall, and deuilish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For where enuying and strife is, there is sedition, and all maner of euill workes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the wisedome that is from aboue, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercie and good fruites, without iudging, and without hipocrisie.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the fruite of righteousnesse is sowen in peace, of them that make peace. </div><ul class='tnav'>
