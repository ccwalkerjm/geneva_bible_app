<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These are the ordinances and the lawes, which ye shall obserue and doe in the lande (which the Lord God of thy fathers giueth thee to possesse it) as long as yee liue vpon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Yee shall vtterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possesse, serued their gods vpon the hie mountaines and vpon the hilles, and vnder euery greene tree.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Also ye shall ouerthrowe their altars, and breake downe their pillars, and burne their groues with fire: and ye shall hew downe ye grauen images of their gods, and abolish their names out of that place.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Ye shall not do so vnto ye Lord your God,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But ye shall seeke the place which the Lord your God shall chose out of all your tribes, to put his Name there, and there to dwell, and thither thou shalt come,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And ye shall bring thither your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the offring of your hands, and your vowes, and your free offrings, and the first borne of your kine and of your sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And there ye shall eate before the Lord your God, and ye shall reioyce in all that yee put your hand vnto, both ye, and your housholdes, because the Lord thy God hath blessed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Ye shall not doe after all these things that we doe here this day: that is, euery man whatsoeuer seemeth him good in his owne eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For ye are not yet come to rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord thy God giueth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But when ye goe ouer Iorden, and dwell in ye land, which the Lord your God hath giuen you to inherit, and when he hath giue you rest from al your enemies round about, and yee dwel in safetie,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When there shalbe a place which the Lord your God shall chose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall yee bring all that I commaund you: your burnt offrings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the offring of your hands, and all your speciall vowes which ye vowe vnto the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And ye shall reioyce before the Lord your God, yee, and your sonnes and your daughters, and your seruaunts, and your maidens, and the Leuite that is within your gates: for hee hath no part nor inheritance with you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Take heede that thou offer not thy burnt offrings in euery place that thou seest:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But in ye place which the Lord shall chose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offrings, and there thou shalt doe all that I commaund thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Notwithstanding thou maiest kill and eate flesh in all thy gates, whatsoeuer thine heart desireth, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath giuen thee: both the vncleane and the cleane may eate thereof, as of the roe bucke, and of the hart.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Onely ye shall not eat the blood, but powre it vpon the earth as water.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou maist nor eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corne, nor of thy wine, nor of thine oyle, nor the first borne of thy kine, nor of thy sheep, neither any of thy vowes which thou vowest, nor thy free offerings, nor the offering of thine hands,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But thou shalt eate it before the Lord thy God, in the place which the Lord thy God shall chuse, thou, and thy sonne, and thy daughter, and thy seruat, and thy maid, and the Leuite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt reioyce before the Lord thy God, in all that thou puttest thine hand to.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Beware, that thou forsake not the Leuite, as long as thou liuest vpon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy border, as hee hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I wil eate flesh, (because thine heart longeth to eate flesh) thou maiest eate flesh, whatsoeuer thine heart desireth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put his Name there, be farre from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy bullockes, and of thy sheepe which the Lord hath giuen thee, as I haue commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates, whatsoeuer thine heart desireth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Euen as the roe bucke, and the hart is eaten, so shalt thou eat them. both the vncleane and the cleane shall eate of them alike.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Onely bee sure that thou eate not the blood: for the blood is the life, and thou maiest not eate the life with the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore thou shalt not eat it, but powre it vpon the earth as water.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thou shalt not eat it, that it may go well with thee; and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt doe that which is right in the sight of the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But thine holy things which thou hast, and thy vowes thou shalt take vp, and come vnto the place which the Lord shall chuse.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And thou shalt make thy burnt offerings of the flesh, and of the blood vpon the altar of the Lord thy God, and the blood of thine offerings shall bee powred vpon the altar of the Lord thy God, and thou shalt eate the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Take heede, and heare all these woordes which I commaund thee, that it may goe well with thee, and with thy children after thee for euer, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When the Lord thy God shall destroy the nations before thee, whither thou goest to possesse them, and thou shalt possesse them and dwell in their lande,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Beware, lest thou be taken in a snare after them, after that they be destroied before thee, and lest thou aske after their gods, saying, Howe did these nations serue their gods, that I may doe so likewise?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Thou shalt not doe so vnto the Lord thy God: for al abomination, which the Lord hateth, haue they done vnto their gods: for they haue burned both their sonnes and their daughters with fire to their gods.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore whatsoeuer I command you, take heede you doe it: thou shalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom. </div><ul class='tnav'>
