And when he was come into the house, Iesus preuented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whome doe the Kings of the earth take tribute, or polle money? of their children, or of strangers?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Peter sayd vnto him, Of strangers. Then said Iesus vnto him, Then are the children free.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, lest we should offend them: goe to the sea, and cast in an angle, and take the first fish that commeth vp, and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt finde a piece of twentie pence: that take, and giue it vnto them for me and thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
