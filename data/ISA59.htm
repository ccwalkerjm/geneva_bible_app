Therefore his arme did saue it, and his righteousnes it selfe did sustaine it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For he put on righteousnes, as an habergeon, and an helmet of saluation vpon his head, and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeale as a cloke.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As to make recompence, as to requite the furie of the aduersaries with a recompence to his enemies: he will fully repaire the ylands.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So shall they feare the Name of the Lord from the West, and his glory from the rising of the sunne: for the enemie shall come like a flood: but the Spirit of the Lord shall chase him away.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Redeemer shall come vnto Zion, and vnto them that turne from iniquitie in Iaakob, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will make this my couenant with them, saith the Lord. My Spirit that is vpon thee, and my wordes, which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seede, nor out of the mouth of the seede of thy seede, saith the Lord, from hencefoorth euen for euer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
