If ye beleeue not, surely ye shall not be established.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord spake againe vnto Ahaz, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Aske a signe for thee of the Lord thy God: aske it, either in the depth beneath or in the height aboue.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Ahaz sayd, I wil not aske, neither will I tempt the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then he sayd, Heare you nowe, O house of Dauid, Is it a small thing for you to grieue men, that ye will also grieue my God?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord himselfe will giue you a signe. Beholde, the virgine shall conceiue and beare a sonne, and she shall call his name Immanu-el.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Butter and hony shall he eate, till he haue knowledge to refuse the euill, and to chuse the good.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For afore the childe shall haue knowledge to eschew the euill, and to chuse the good, the land, that thou abhorrest, shalbe forsaken of both her Kings.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Lord shall bring vpon thee, and vpon thy people, and vpon thy fathers house (the dayes that haue not come from the day that Ephraim departed from Iudah) euen the King of Asshur.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And in that day shall the Lord hisse for the flie that is at the vttermost part of the floods of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the lande of Asshur,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they shall come and shall light all in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rockes, and vpon all thorny places, and vpon all bushy places.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In that day shall the Lord shaue with a rasor that is hired, euen by them beyond the Riuer, by the King of Asshur, the head and the heare of the feete, and it shall consume the beard.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And in the same day shall a man nourish a yong kow, and two sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And for the abundance of milke, that they shall giue, hee shall eate butter: for butter and hony shall euery one eate, which is left within the land.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And at the same day euery place, wherein shalbe a thousand vines, shalbe at a thousand pieces of siluer: so it shalbe for the briers and for the thornes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>With arrowes and with bowe shall one come thither: because all the land shall be briers and thornes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But on all the mountaines, which shalbe digged with the mattocke, there shall not come thither the feare of briers and thornes: but they shalbe for the sending out of bullocks, and for the treading of sheepe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
