We haue heard with our eares, O God: our fathers haue tolde vs the workes, that thou hast done in their dayes, in the olde time:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Howe thou hast driuen out the heathen with thine hand, and planted them: how thou hast destroyed the people, and caused them to grow.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For they inherited not the lande by their owne sworde, neither did their owne arme saue them: but thy right hand, and thine arme and the light of thy countenance, because thou didest fauour them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Thou art my King, O God: send helpe vnto Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Through thee haue we thrust backe our aduersaries: by thy Name haue we troden downe them that rose vp against vs.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I do not trust in my bowe, neither can my sworde saue me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But thou hast saued vs from our aduersaries, and hast put them to confusion that hate vs.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore will wee praise God continually, and will confesse thy Name for euer. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But now thou art farre off, and puttest vs to confusion, and goest not forth with our armies.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou makest vs to turne backe from the aduersary, and they, which hate vs, spoile for theselues.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thou giuest vs as sheepe to bee eaten, and doest scatter vs among the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou sellest thy people without gaine, and doest not increase their price.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou makest vs a reproche to our neighbours, a iest and a laughing stocke to them that are round about vs.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou makest vs a prouerbe among the nations, and a nodding of the head among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My confusion is dayly before me, and the shame of my face hath couered me,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For the voyce of the slaunderer and rebuker, for the enemie and auenger.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All this is come vpon vs, yet doe wee not forget thee, neither deale wee falsly concerning thy couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Our heart is not turned backe: neither our steps gone out of thy paths,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Albeit thou hast smitten vs downe into the place of dragons, and couered vs with the shadow of death.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>If wee haue forgotten the Name of our God, and holden vp our hands to a strange god,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Shall not God searche this out? for hee knoweth the secrets of the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Surely for thy sake are we slaine continually, and are counted as sheepe for the slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Vp, why sleepest thou, O Lord? awake, be not farre off for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Wherefore hidest thou thy face? and forgettest our miserie and our affliction?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For our soule is beaten downe vnto the dust: our belly cleaueth vnto the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Rise vp for our succour, and redeeme vs for thy mercies sake. </div><ul class='tnav'>
