Beholde, for your iniquities are yee solde, and because of your transgressions is your mother forsaken.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Wherefore came I, and there was no man? I called, and none answered: is mine hand so shortened, that it cannot helpe? or haue I no power to deliuer? Beholde, at my rebuke I drie vp the Sea: I make the floods desert: their fish rotteth for want of water, and dieth for thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I clothe the heauens with darkenesse, and make a sacke their couering.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The Lord God hath giuen me a tongue of the learned, that I shoulde knowe to minister a woord in time to him that is weary: he will raise me vp in the morning: in the morning hee will waken mine eare to heare, as the learned.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The Lord God hath opened mine eare and I was not rebellious, neither turned I backe.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I gaue my backe vnto the smiters, and my cheekes to the nippers: I hidde not my face from shame and spitting.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the Lord God will helpe me, therefore shall I not bee confounded: therefore haue I set my face like a flint, and I knowe that I shall not be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Hee is neere that iustifieth mee: who will contend with me? Let vs stande together: who is mine aduersarie? let him come neere to me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Beholde, the Lord God will helpe me: who is he that can condemne me? loe, they shall waxe olde as a garment: the mothe shall eate them vp.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who is among you that feareth the Lord? let him heare the voyce of his seruant: hee that walketh in darkenesse, and hath no light, let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and staye vpon his God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Beholde, all you kindle a fire, and are compassed about with sparkes: walke in the light of your fire, and in the sparkes that ye haue kindled. This shall ye haue of mine hand: ye shall lye downe in sorowe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
