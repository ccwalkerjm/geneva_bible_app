<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 49</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>To him that excelleth. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. Heare this, all ye people: giue eare, all ye that dwell in the world,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>As well lowe as hie, both rich and poore.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>My mouth shall speake of wisdome, and the meditation of mine heart is of knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will incline mine eare to a parable, and vtter my graue matter vpon the harpe.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Wherefore should I feare in the euil dayes, when iniquitie shall compasse me about, as at mine heeles?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They trust in their goods, and boast them selues in the multitude of their riches.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Yet a man can by no meanes redeeme his brother: he can not giue his raunsome to God,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>(So precious is the redemption of their soules, and the continuance for euer)  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>That he may liue still for euer, and not see the graue.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For he seeth that wise men die, and also that the ignorant and foolish perish, and leaue their riches for others.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yet they thinke, their houses, and their habitations shall continue for euer, euen from generation to generation, and call their lands by their names.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But man shall not continue in honour: he is like the beastes that die.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>This their way vttereth their foolishnes: yet their posteritie delite in their talke. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Like sheepe they lie in graue: death deuoureth them, and the righteous shall haue domination ouer them in the morning: for their beautie shall consume, when they shall goe from their house to graue.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But God shall deliuer my soule from the power of the graue: for he will receiue me. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Be not thou afrayd when one is made rich, and when the glory of his house is increased.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For he shall take nothing away when he dieth, neither shall his pompe descende after him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For while he liued, he reioyced himselfe: and men will prayse thee, when thou makest much of thy selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He shall enter into the generation of his fathers, and they shall not liue for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Man is in honour, and vnderstandeth not: he is like to beasts that perish. </div><ul class='tnav'>
