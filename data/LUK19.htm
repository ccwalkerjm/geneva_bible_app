Thou knewest that I am a straight man, taking vp that I layd not downe, and reaping that I did not sowe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Wherefore then gauest not thou my money into the banke, that at my coming I might haue required it with vantage?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he sayd to them that stoode by, Take from him that piece, and giue it him that hath ten pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>(And they sayd vnto him, Lord, hee hath ten pieces.)  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For I say vnto you, that vnto all them that haue, it shalbe giuen: and from him that hath not, euen that he hath, shalbe taken from him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Moreouer, those mine enemies, which would not that I should reigne ouer them, bring hither, and slay them before me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when he had thus spoken, he went forth before, ascending vp to Hierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to passe, when hee was come neere to Bethphage, and Bethania, besides the mount which is called the mount of Oliues, he sent two of his disciples,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Saying, Goe ye to the towne which is before you, wherein, assoone as ye are come, ye shall finde a colte tied, whereon neuer man sate: loose him, and bring him hither.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And if any man aske you, why ye loose him, thus shall ye say vnto him, Because the Lord hath neede of him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So they that were sent, went their way, and found it as he had sayd vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And as they were loosing the colte, the owners thereof sayd vnto them, Why loose ye the colte?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they sayd, The Lord hath neede of him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So they brought him to Iesus, and they cast their garments on the colte, and set Iesus thereon.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as he went, they spred their clothes in the way.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And when he was nowe come neere to the going downe of the mount of Oliues, the whole multitude of the disciples began to reioyce, and to prayse God with a loude voyce, for all the great workes that they had seene,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Saying, Blessed be the King that commeth in the Name of the Lord: peace in heauen, and glory in the highest places.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then some of the Pharises of the companie sayd vnto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But he answered, and sayd vnto them, I tell you, that if these should holde their peace, the stones would crie.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when he was come neere, he behelde the Citie, and wept for it,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Saying, O if thou haddest euen knowen at the least in this thy day those things, which belong vnto thy peace! but nowe are they hid from thine eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>For the dayes shall come vpon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compasse thee round, and keepe thee in on euery side,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And shall make thee euen with ye ground, and thy children which are in thee, and they shall not leaue in thee a stone vpon a stone, because thou knewest not that season of thy visitation.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>He went also into the Temple, and began to cast out them that solde therein, and them that bought,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Saying vnto them, It is written, Mine house is the house of prayer, but ye haue made it a denne of theeues.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And he taught dayly in the Temple. And the hie Priests and the Scribes, and the chiefe of the people sought to destroy him.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>But they could not finde what they might doe to him: for all the people hanged vpon him when they heard him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
