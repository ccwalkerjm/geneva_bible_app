And they answered Pharaoh, Thy seruants are shepheards, both we and our fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They sayde moreouer vnto Pharaoh, For to soiourne in ye lande are we come: for thy seruants haue no pasture for their sheepe, so sore is ye famine in the lande of Canaan. Nowe therefore, we pray thee, let thy seruants dwel in the land of Goshen.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then spake Pharaoh to Ioseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The lande of Egypt is before thee: in the best place of the land make thy father and thy brethren dwel: let the dwel in the land of Goshen: and if thou knowest that there be men of actiuitie among them, make them rulers ouer my cattell.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ioseph also brought Iaakob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Iaakob saluted Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh sayde vnto Iaakob, Howe olde art thou?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Iaakob sayd vnto Pharaoh, The whole time of my pilgrimage is an hundreth and thirty yeeres: fewe and euill haue the dayes of my life bene, and I haue not attayned vnto the yeeres of the life of my fathers, in the dayes of their pilgrimages.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Iaakob tooke leaue of Pharaoh, and departed from the presence of Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Ioseph placed his father, and his brethren, and gaue them possession in the lande of Egypt, in the best of the land, euen in the lande of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Ioseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his fathers houshold with bread, euen to the yong children.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now there was no bread in all the land: for the famine was exceeding sore: so that the land of Egypt, and the land of Canaan were famished by reason of the famine.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Ioseph gathered all the money, that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corne which they bought, and Ioseph layd vp the money in Pharaohs house.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So when money fayled in the lande of Egypt, and in the lande of Canaan, then all the Egyptians came vnto Ioseph, and sayde, Giue vs bread: for why should we dye before thee? for our money is spent.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then saide Ioseph, Bring your cattell, and I will giue you for your cattell, if your money be spent.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So they brought their cattell vnto Ioseph, and Ioseph gaue them bread for the horses, and for the flockes of sheepe, and for the heards of cattel, and for the asses: so he fed them with bread for all their cattell that yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But when the yeere was ended, they came vnto him the next yeere, and sayd vnto him, We will not hide from my lord, that since our money is spent, and my lord hath the heards of the cattel, there is nothing left in the sight of my lorde, but our bodies and our ground.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Why shall we perish in thy sight, both we, and our land? bye vs and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bonde to Pharaoh: therefore giue vs seede, that we may liue and not dye, and that the land go not to waste.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So Ioseph bought all the lande of Egypt for Pharaoh: for the Egyptians solde euery man his ground because the famine was sore vpon the: so the land became Pharaohs.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he remoued the people vnto the cities, from one side of Egypt euen to the other.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Onely the lande of the Priestes bought he not: for the Priestes had an ordinarie of Pharaoh, and they did eate their ordinarie, which Pharaoh gaue them: wherefore they solde not their grounde.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Ioseph sayd vnto the people, Behold, I haue bought you this daye, and your lande for Pharaoh: lo, here is seede for you: sowe therefore the grounde.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And of the encrease ye shall giue the fifth part vnto Pharaoh, and foure partes shalbe yours for the seede of the fielde, and for your meate, and for them of your housholdes, and for your children to eate.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then they answered, Thou hast saued our liues: let vs finde grace in the sight of my Lord, and we will be Pharaohs seruants.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Ioseph made it a lawe ouer the land of Egypt vnto this day, that Pharaoh should haue the fift part, except the land of the priests only, which was not Pharaohs.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Israel dwelt in the lande of Egypt, in the countrey of Goshen: and they had their possessions therein, and grewe and multiplied exceedingly.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Moreouer, Iaakob liued in the lande of Egypt seuenteene yeeres, so that the whole age of Iaakob was an hundreth fourtie and seuen yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Now when the time drewe neere that Israel must dye, he called his sonne Ioseph, and sayde vnto him, If I haue nowe founde grace in thy sight, put thine hand nowe vnder my thigh, and deale mercifully and truely with me: burie me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But when I shall sleepe with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury mee in their buryall. And he answered, I will doe as thou hast sayde.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The he said, Sweare vnto me. And he sware vnto him.
