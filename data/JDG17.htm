Then his mother saide, Blessed be my sonne of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And when he had restored the eleuen hundreth shekels of siluer to his mother, his mother sayd, I had dedicate the siluer to the Lord of mine hand for my sonne, to make a grauen and molten image. Now therfore I will giue it thee again.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when he had restored the money vnto his mother, his mother tooke two hundreth shekels of siluer, and gaue them to the founder, which made thereof a grauen and molten image, and it was in the house of Michah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And this man Michah had an house of gods, and made an Ephod, and Teraphim, and cosecrated one of his sonnes, who was his Priest.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In those dayes there was no King in Israel, but euery man did that which was good in his owne eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There was also a yong man out of Bethlehem Iudah, of the familie of Iudah: who was a Leuite, and soiourned there.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the man departed out of the citie, euen out of Beth-lehem Iudah, to dwell where he coulde finde a place: and as he iourneyed, he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Michah  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Michah saide vnto him, Whence comest thou? And the Leuite answered him, I come from Beth-lehem Iudah, and goe to dwell where I may finde a place.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Michah said vnto him, Dwell with me, and be vnto me a father and a Priest, and I will giue thee ten shekels of siluer by yeere, and a sute of apparell, and thy meate and drinke. So the Leuite went in.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Leuite was content to dwel with the man, and the yong man was vnto him as one of his owne sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Michah consecrated the Leuite, and the yong man was his Priest, and was in the house of Michah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then said Michah, Nowe I know that the Lord will be good vnto me, seeing I haue a Leuite to my Priest. </div><ul class='tnav'>
