<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 107</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Praise the Lord, because he is good: for his mercie endureth for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Let them, which haue bene redeemed of the Lord, shewe how he hath deliuered them from the hand of the oppressour,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And gathered them out of the lands, from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When they wandered in the desert and wildernesse out of the waie, and founde no citie to dwell in,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Both hungrie and thirstie, their soule fainted in them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then they cried vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he deliuered them from their distresse,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And led them forth by the right way, that they might goe to a citie of habitation.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let them therefore confesse before ye Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For he satisfied the thirstie soule, and filled the hungrie soule with goodnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They that dwell in darkenesse and in the shadowe of death, being bounde in miserie and yron,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because they rebelled against the wordes of the Lord, and despised the counsell of the most High,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When he humbled their heart with heauines, then they fell downe and there was no helper.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then they cried vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he deliuered them from their distresse.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He brought them out of darkenes, and out of the shadowe of death, and brake their bandes asunder.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let them therefore cofesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For hee hath broken the gates of brasse, and brast the barres of yron asunder.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Fooles by reason of their transgression, and because of their iniquities are afflicted.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Their soule abhorreth al meat, and they are brought to deaths doore.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then they crie vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he deliuereth them from their distresse.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He sendeth his worde and healeth them, and deliuereth them from their graues.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Let them therefore cofesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderful workes before the sonnes of men,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And let them offer sacrifices of praise, and declare his workes with reioycing.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They that goe downe to the sea in ships, and occupie by the great waters,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They see the woorkes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deepe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For he commaundeth and raiseth the stormie winde, and it lifteth vp the waues thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They mount vp to the heauen, and descend to ye deepe, so that their soule melteth for trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They are tossed to and from, and stagger like a drunken man, and all their cunning is gone.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then they crie vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresse.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He turneth the storme to calme, so that the waues thereof are still.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When they are quieted, they are glad, and hee bringeth them vnto the hauen, where they would be.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Let them therfore confesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And let them exalt him in the Congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the Elders.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He turneth the floodes into a wildernesse, and the springs of waters into drinesse,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And a fruitfull land into barrennes for the wickednes of them that dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Againe hee turneth the wildernesse into pooles of water, and the drie lande into water springs.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And there he placeth the hungrie, and they builde a citie to dwell in,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And sowe the fieldes, and plant vineyardes, which bring foorth fruitfull increase.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For he blesseth them, and they multiplie exceedingly, and he diminisheth not their cattell.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Againe men are diminished, and brought lowe by oppression, euill and sorowe.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He powreth contempt vpon princes, and causeth them to erre in desert places out of the way.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Yet he raiseth vp the poore out of miserie, and maketh him families like a flocke of sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The righteous shall see it, and reioyce, and all iniquitie shall stoppe her mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Who is wise that hee may obserue these things? for they shall vnderstand the louing kindnesse of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
