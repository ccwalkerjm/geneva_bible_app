But Dauid auoyded twise out of his presence.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Saul was afrayd of Dauid, because the Lord was with him, and was departed from Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore Saul put him from him, and made him a captaine ouer a thousand, and he went out and in before the people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Dauid behaued himselfe wisely in all his wayes: for the Lord was with him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Wherefore when Saul saw that he was very wise, he was afrayde of him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For all Israel and Iudah loued Dauid, because he went out and in before them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Saul sayd to Dauid, Beholde mine eldest daughter Merab, her I will giue thee to wife: onely be a valiant sonne vnto me, and fight the Lordes battels: for Saul thought, Mine hand shall not be vpon him, but the hand of the Philistims shalbe vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Dauid answered Saul, What am I? and what is my life, or the family of my father in Israel, that I should be sonne in law to the King?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Howbeit when Merab Sauls daughter should haue bene giuen to Dauid, she was giuen vnto Adriel a Meholathite to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Michal Sauls daughter loued Dauid: and they shewed Saul, and the thing pleased him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore Saul said, I wil giue him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistims may bee against him. Wherefore Saul sayde to Dauid, Thou shalt this day be my sonne in law in the one of the twayne.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Saul commanded his seruants, Speake with Dauid secretly, and say, Behold, ye King hath a fauour to thee, and all his seruants loue thee: be now therefore the Kings sonne in law.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Sauls seruantes spake these wordes in the eares of Dauid. And Dauid sayd, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a Kings sonne in lawe, seeing that I am a poore man and of small reputation?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And then Sauls seruats brought him word againe, saying, Such wordes spake Dauid.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Saul sayd, This wise shall ye say to Dauid, The King desireth no dowrie, but an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistims, to bee auenged of the Kings enemies: for Saul thought to make Dauid fall into the handes of the Philistims.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when his seruantes tolde Dauid these wordes, it pleased Dauid well, to be the Kings sonne in law: and the dayes were not expired.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Afterwarde Dauid arose with his men, and went and slewe of the Philistims two hundreth men: and Dauid brought their foreskinnes, and they gaue them wholly to the King that hee might be the Kings sonne in lawe: therefore Saul gaue him Michal his daughter to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Saul sawe, and vnderstoode that the Lord was with Dauid, and that Michal the daughter of Saul loued him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Saul was more and more afrayde of Dauid, and Saul became alway Dauids enemie.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when the Princes of the Philistims went forth, at their going forth Dauid behaued himselfe more wisely then all the seruants of Saul, so that his name was much set by. </div><ul class='tnav'>
