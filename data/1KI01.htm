And he gate him charets and horsemen, and fiftie men to run before him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And his father would not displease him from his childehood, to say, Why hast thou done so? And hee was a very goodly man, and his mother bare him next after Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he tooke counsel of Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, and of Abiathar the Priest: and they helped forward Adoniiah.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But Zadok the Priest, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and Nathan the Prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the men of might, which were with Dauid, were not with Adoniiah.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Adoniiah sacrificed sheepe and oxen, and fat cattel by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the kings sonnes, and al the men of Iudah ye Kings seruants,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah, and the mightie men, and Salomon his brother hee called not.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wherefore Nathan spake vnto Bath-sheba the mother of Salomon, saying, Hast thou not heard, that Adoniiah ye sonne of Haggith doeth reigne, and Dauid our lord knoweth it not?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now therefore come, and I will now giue thee counsell, howe to saue thine owne life, and the life of thy sonne Salomon.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Go, and get thee in vnto King Dauid, and say vnto him, Didest not thou, my lorde, O King, sweare vnto thine handmaide, saying, Assuredly Salomon thy sonne shall reigne after me, and he shall sit vpon my throne? why is then Adoniiah King?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the King, I also will come in after thee, and confirme thy wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So Bath-sheba went in vnto the King into the chamber, and the King was verie olde, and Abishag the Shunammite ministred vnto ye King.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Bath-sheba bowed and made obeisance vnto the King. And the King saide, What is thy matter?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And shee answered him, My lorde, thou swarest by the Lord thy God vnto thine handmaide, saying, Assuredly Salomon thy sonne shall reigne after me, and he shall sit vpon my throne.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And beholde, nowe is Adoniiah king, and now, my lord, O King, thou knowest it not.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he hath offred many oxen, and fatte cattel, and sheepe, and hath called all the sonnes of the King, and Abiathar the Priest, and Ioab the captaine of the hoste: but Salomon thy seruant hath he not bidden.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou, my lorde, O King, knowest that the eyes of all Israel are on thee, that thou shouldest tell them, who shoulde sit on the throne of my lord the King after him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For els when my lord the King shall sleepe with his fathers, I and my sonne Salomon shalbe reputed vile.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And lo, while she yet talked with the King, Nathan also the Prophet came in.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they tolde the King, saying, Beholde, Nathan the Prophet. And when he was come in to the King, hee made obeisance before the King vpon his face to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Nathan saide, My lorde, O King, hast thou said, Adoniiah shall reigne after mee, and he shall sit vpon my throne?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For hee is gone downe this day, and hath slaine many oxen, and fat cattel, and sheepe, and hath called al the Kings sonnes, and the captaines of the hoste, and Abiathar the Priest: and behold, they eate and drinke before him, and say, God saue King Adoniiah.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But me thy seruant, and Zadok the Priest, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and thy seruant Salomon hath he not called.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Is this thing done by my lord the King, and thou hast not shewed it vnto thy seruant, who should sitte on the throne of my lorde the King after him?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then King Dauid answered, and saide, Call me Bath-sheba. And shee came into ye Kings presence, and stoode before the King.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the King sware, saying, As the Lord liueth, who hath redeemed my soule out of all aduersitie,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>That as I sware vnto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Salomon thy sonne shall reigne after me, and hee shall sit vpon my throne in my place, so will I certainely doe this day.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Bath-sheba bowed her face to the earth, and did reuerence vnto the King, and said, God saue my lord King Dauid for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And King Dauid saide, Call mee Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada.
