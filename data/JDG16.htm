<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then went Samson to Azzah, and sawe there an harlot, and went in vnto her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And it was tolde to the Azzahites, Samson is come hither. And they went about, and laied wayte for him all night in the gate of the citie, and were quiet all the nyght, saying, Abide till the morning earely, and we shall kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Samson slept till midnight, and arose at midnight, and tooke the doores of the gates of the citie, and the two postes and lift them away with the barres, and put them vpon his shoulders, and caried them vp to the top of the mountaine that is before Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And after this hee loued a woman by the riuer of Sorek, whose name was Delilah:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Vnto whome came the princes of the Philistims, and said vnto her, Entise him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what meane we may ouercome him, that we may binde him, and punish him, and euery one of vs shall giue thee eleuen hundreth shekels of siluer.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Delilah saide to Samson, Tell mee, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest bee bound, to doe thee hurt.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Samson then answered vnto her, If they binde mee with seuen greene cordes, that were neuer dryed, then shall I bee weake, and be as an other man.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the princes of the Philistims brought her seuen greene cordes that were not dry, and she bound him therewith.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>(And she had men lying in wayte with her in the chamber) Then she said vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson. And hee brake the cordes, as a threede of towe is broken, when it feeleth fire: so his strength was not knowen.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>After Delilah saide vnto Samson, See, thou hast mocked mee and tolde mee lies. I pray thee nowe, tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then he answered her, If they binde mee with newe ropes that neuer were occupied, then shall I be weake, and be as an other man.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Delilah therefore tooke newe ropes, and bounde him therewith, and saide vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson: (and men lay in wayte in the chamber) and hee brake them from his armes, as a threede.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Afterward Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto thou hast beguiled mee, and tolde me lies: tell me how thou mightest be bounde. And he sayde vnto her, If thou plattedst seuen lockes of mine head with the threedes of the woufe.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And she fastened it with a pinne, and saide vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleepe, and went away with the pinne of the webbe and the woufe.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Againe shee sayde vnto him, Howe canst thou say, I loue thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked mee these three times, and hast not tolde me wherein thy great strength lieth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And because shee was importunate vpon him with her wordes continually, and vexed him, his soule was pained vnto the death.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore he tolde her all his heart, and said vnto her, There neuer came rasor vpon mine head: for I am a Nazarite vnto God from my mothers wombe: therefore if I bee shauen, my strength will goe from me, and I shalbe weake, and be like all other men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when Delilah sawe that he had tolde her all his heart, she sent, and called for the Princes of ye Philistims, saying, Come vp once againe: for he hath shewed mee all his heart. Then the Princes of the Philistims came vp vnto her, and brought the money in their handes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And she made him sleepe vpon her knees, and she called a man, and made him to shaue off the seuen lockes of his head, and shee began to vexe him, and his strength was gone from him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then she said, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson. And hee awoke out of his sleepe, and thought, I will go out now as at other times, and shake my selfe, but he knewe not that the Lord was departed from him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore the Philistims tooke him, and put out his eyes, and brought him downe to Azzah, and bounde him with fetters: and hee did grinde in the prison house.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the heare of his head began to growe againe after that it was shauen.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then the Princes of the Philistims gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice vnto Dagon their god, and to reioyce: for they said, Our god hath deliuered Samson our enemie into our handes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Also when the people saw him, they praysed their god: for they sayde, Our god hath deliuered into our hands our enemie and destroyer of our countrey, which hath slayne many of vs.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when their heartes were merie, they said, Call Samson, that he may make vs pastime. So they called Samson out of the prison house, and he was a laughing stocke vnto them, and they set him betweene the pillars.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Samson saide vnto the seruant that led him by the hande, Lead me, that I may touch the pillars that the house standeth vpon, and that I may leane to them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>(Nowe the house was full of men and women, and there were all the princes of the Philistims: also vpon the roofe were about three thousande men and women that behelde while Samson played)  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Samson called vnto the Lord, and sayde, O Lord God, I pray thee, thinke vpon me: O God, I beseech thee, strengthen me at this time onely, that I may be at once auenged of the Philistims for my two eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Samson layd hold on the two middle pillars whereupon the house stood, and on which it was borne vp: on the one with his right hand, and on the other with his left.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Samson saide, Let me lose my life with the Philistims: and he bowed him with all his might, and the house fell vpon the princes, and vpon all the people that were therein. so the dead which he slewe at his death were more then they which he had slaine in his life.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then his brethren, and all the house of his father came downe and tooke him, and brought him vp and buryed him betweene Zorah and Eshtaol, in the sepulchre of Manoah his father: nowe he had iudged Israel twenty yeeres. </div><ul class='tnav'>
