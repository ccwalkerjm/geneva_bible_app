Give thy iudgements to the King, O God, and thy righteousnesse to the Kings sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then shall he iudge thy people in righteousnesse, and thy poore with equitie.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The mountaines and the hilles shall bring peace to the people by iustice.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He shall iudge the poore of the people: he shall saue the children of the needie, and shall subdue the oppressor.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They shall feare thee as long as the sunne and moone endureth, from generatio to generation.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He shall come downe like the rayne vpon the mowen grasse, and as the showres that water the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In his dayes shall the righteous florish, and abundance of peace shalbe so long as the moone endureth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>His dominion shall be also from sea to sea, and from the Riuer vnto the endes of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They that dwell in ye wildernes, shall kneele before him, and his enemies shall licke the dust.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Kings of Tarshish and of the yles shall bring presents: the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring giftes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yea, all Kings shall worship him: all nations shall serue him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For he shall deliuer the poore when he cryeth: the needie also, and him that hath no helper.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He shalbe mercifull to the poore and needie, and shall preserue the soules of the poore.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He shall redeeme their soules from deceite and violence, and deare shall their blood be in his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yea, he shall liue, and vnto him shall they giue of the golde of Sheba: they shall also pray for him continually, and dayly blesse him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>An handfull of corne shall be sowen in the earth, euen in the toppe of the mountaines, and the fruite thereof shall shake like the trees of Lebanon: and the children shall florish out of the citie like the grasse of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>His name shall be for euer: his name shall indure as long as the sunne: all nations shall blesse him, and be blessed in him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord God, euen the God of Israel, which onely doeth wonderous things.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And blessed be his glorious Name for euer: and let all the earth be filled with his glorie. So be it, euen so be it. HERE END THE prayers of Dauid, the sonne of Ishai. </div><ul class='tnav'>
