 <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Memucan answered before the King and the Princes, The Queene Vashti hath not only done euill against the King, but against all the princes, and against all the people that are in all the prouinces of King Ahashuerosh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the acte of the Queene shall come abroade vnto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their owne eyes, and shall say, The King Ahashuerosh comanded Vashti the Queene to be brought in before him, but she came not.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So shall the princesses of Persia and Media this day say vnto all the Kings Princes, when they heare of the acte of the Queene: thus shall there be much despitefulnesse and wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If it please the King, let a royal decree proceede from him, and let it be written among the statutes of Persia, and Media, (and let it not be transgressed) that Vashti come no more before King Ahashuerosh: and let the King giue her royal estate vnto her companion that is better then she.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when the decree of the King which shalbe made, shalbe published throughout all his kingdome (though it be great) all the women shall giue their husbands honour, both great and small.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And this saying pleased the King and the princes, and the King did according to the worde of Memucan.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For he sent letters into all the prouinces of the King, into euery prouince according to the writing thereof, and to euery people after their language, that euery man should beare rule in his owne house, and that he should publish it in the language of that same people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
