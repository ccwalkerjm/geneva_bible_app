And againe, The Lord shall iudge his people.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Nowe call to remembrance the dayes that are passed, in the which, after ye had receiued light, ye endured a great fight in afflictions,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Partly while yee were made a gazing stocke both by reproches and afflictions, and partly while ye became companions of them which were so tossed to and from.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For both ye sorowed with mee for my bonds, and suffered with ioy the spoyling of your goods, knowing in your selues howe that ye haue in heauen a better, and an enduring substance.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For ye haue neede of patience, that after ye haue done the will of God, ye might receiue the promise.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For yet a very litle while, and hee that shall come, will come, and will not tary.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Nowe the iust shall liue by faith: but if any withdrawe himselfe, my soule shall haue no pleasure in him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But we are not they which withdrawe our selues vnto perdition, but follow faith vnto the conseruation of the soule. </div><ul class='tnav'>
