Then Manoah knewe that it was an Angel of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Manoah said vnto his wife, We shall surely dye, because we haue seene God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But his wife saide vnto him, If the Lord woulde kill vs, he woulde not haue receiued a burnt offring, and a meate offring of our hands, neither would he haue shewed vs all these things, nor would now haue tolde vs any such.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the wife bare a sonne, and called his name Samson: and the childe grewe, and the Lord blessed him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the Spirite of the Lord beganne to strengthen him in the host of Dan, betweene Zorah, and Eshtaol. </div><ul class='tnav'>
