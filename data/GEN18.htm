And they said, Do euen as thou hast said.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Abraham made haste into the tent vnto Sarah, and saide, Make ready at once three measures of fine meale: kneade it, and make cakes vpon the hearth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Abraham ranne to the beastes, and tooke a tender and good calfe, and gaue it to the seruant, who hasted to make it ready.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he tooke butter and milke, and the calfe, which he had prepared, and set before them, and stoode himselfe by them vnder the tree, and they did eate.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then they saide to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he answered, Beholde, she is in the tent.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he saide, I will certainely come againe vnto thee according to ye time of life: and loe, Sarah thy wife shall haue a sonne. and Sarah heard in the tent doore, which was behinde him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>(Nowe Abraham and Sarah were old and striken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the maner of women)  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore Sarah laughed within her selfe, saying, After I am waxed olde, and my lord also, shall I haue lust?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And ye Lord saide vnto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah thus laugh, saying, Shall I certainely beare a childe, which am olde?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>(Shall any thing be hard to the Lord? at the time appointed will I returne vnto thee, euen according to the time of life, and Sarah shall haue a sonne.)  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not: for she was afraide. And he said, It is not so: for thou laughedst.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Afterwarde the men did rise vp from thence and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doe,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Seeing that Abraham shalbe in deede a great and a mightie nation, and all the nations of the earth shalbe blessed in him?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I knowe him that he will commande his sonnes and his houshold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, to doe righteousnesse and iudgement, that the Lord may bring vpon Abraham that he hath spoken vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then the Lord saide, Because the crie of Sodom and Gomorah is great, and because their sinne is exceeding grieuous,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I will goe downe nowe, and see whether they haue done altogether according to that crie which is come vnto me: and if not, that I may knowe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the men turned thence and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stoode yet before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Abraham drewe neere, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If there be fiftie righteous within the citie, wilt thou destroy and not spare the place for the fiftie righteous that are therein?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Be it farre from thee from doing this thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be euen as the wicked, be it farre from thee. shall not the Iudge of all the worlde doe right?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Lord answered, If I shall finde in Sodom fiftie righteous within the citie, then will I spare all the place for their sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Abraham answered and said, Behold nowe, I haue begun to speake vnto my Lord, and I am but dust and ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>If there shall lacke fiue of fiftie righteous, wilt thou destroy all the citie for fiue? And he saide, If I finde there fiue and fourtie, I will not destroy it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he yet spake to him againe, and saide, What if there shalbe found fourtie there? Then he answered, I will not doe it for fourties sake.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Againe he said, Let not my Lord nowe be angry, that I speake, What if thirtie be founde there? Then he saide, I will not doe it, if I finde thirtie there.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Moreouer he said, Behold, now I haue begonne to speake vnto my Lord, What if twentie be founde there? And he answered, I will not destroy it for twenties sake.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then he saide, Let not my Lord be nowe angrie, and I will speake but this once, What if tenne be found there? And he answered, I will not destroy it for tennes sake.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the Lord went his way when he had left communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned vnto his place. </div><ul class='tnav'>
