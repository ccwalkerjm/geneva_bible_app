A reede shaken with the winde?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that weare soft clothing, are in Kings houses.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But what went ye out to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say vnto you, and more then a Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For this is he of whom it is written, Beholde, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto you, among them which are begotten of women, arose there not a greater then Iohn Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is the least in the kingdome of heauen, is greater then he.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And from the time of Iohn Baptist hitherto, the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For all the Prophetes and the Lawe prophecied vnto Iohn.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if ye will receiue it, this is that Elias, which was to come.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like vnto litle children which sit in the markets, and call vnto their fellowes,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And say, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced, we haue mourned vnto you, and ye haue not lamented.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For Iohn came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a deuill.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The sonne of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Beholde a glutton and a drinker of wine, a friend vnto Publicanes and sinners: but wisedome is iustified of her children.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then began he to vpbraide the cities, wherein most of his great workes were done, because they repented not.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Woe be to thee, Chorazin: Woe be to thee, Bethsaida: for if ye great workes, which were done in you, had bene done in Tyrus and Sidon, they had repented long agone in sackecloth and ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But I say to you, It shalbe easier for Tyrus and Sidon at the day of iudgement, then for you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And thou, Capernaum, which art lifted vp vnto heauen, shalt be brought downe to hell: for if the great workes, which haue bin done in thee, had bene done among them of Sodom, they had remained to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But I say vnto you, that it shall be easier for them of the land of Sodom in the day of iudgement, then for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>At that time Iesus answered, and saide, I giue thee thankes, O Father, Lord of heauen and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and men of vnderstanding, and hast opened them vnto babes.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>It is so, O Father, because thy good pleasure was such.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>All things are giuen vnto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Sonne, but ye Father: neither knoweth any man ye Father, but the Sonne, and he to whom ye Sonne will reueile him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Come vnto me, all ye that are wearie and laden, and I will ease you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Take my yoke on you, and learne of me that I am meeke and lowly in heart: and ye shall finde rest vnto your soules.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For my yoke is easie, and my burden light. </div><ul class='tnav'>
