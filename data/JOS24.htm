<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Ioshua assembled againe all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called the Elders of Israel, and their heades, and their iudges, and their officers, and they presented themselues before God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then Ioshua said vnto all the people, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt beyond the flood in olde time, euen Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor, and serued other gods.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I tooke your father Abraham from beyond the flood, and brought him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seede, and gaue him Izhak.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And I gaue vnto Izhak, Iaakob and Esau: and I gaue vnto Esau mount Seir, to possesse it: but Iaakob and his children went downe into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt: and when I had so done among them, I brought you out.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came vnto the Sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with charets and horsemen vnto the red sea.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then they cryed vnto the Lord, and he put a darkenesse betweene you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea vpon them, and couered them: so your eyes haue seene what I haue done in Egypt also ye dwelt in the wildernesse a long season.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>After, I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt beyond Iorden, and they fought with you: but I gaue them into your hand, and ye possessed their countrey, and I destroyed them out of your sight.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Also Balak the sonne of Zippor King of Moab arose and warred against Israel, and sent to call Balaam the sonne of Beor for to curse you,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But I would not heare Balaam: therefore he blessed you, and I deliuered you out of his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And ye went ouer Iorden, and came vnto Iericho, and the men of Iericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hiuites and the Iebusites, and I deliuered them into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I sent hornets before you, which cast them out before you, euen the two kings of the Amorites, and not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I haue giuen you a land, wherein ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and yee dwell in them, and eate of the vineyards and oliue trees, which yee planted not.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nowe therefore feare the Lord, and serue him in vprightnesse and in trueth, and put away the gods, which your fathers serued beyonde the flood and in Egypt, and serue the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And if it seeme euill vnto you to serue the Lord, choose you this day whome yee will serue, whether the gods which your fathers serued (that were beyond the flood) or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwel: but I and mine house will serue the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then the people answered and saide, God forbid, that we shoulde forsake the Lord, to serue other gods.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the Lord our God, he brought vs and our fathers out of the lande of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and he did those great miracles in our sight, and preserued vs in all the way that we went, and among all the people through whome we came.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord did cast out before vs all the people, euen the Amorites which dwelt in the lande: therefore will we also serue the Lord, for he is our God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Ioshua saide vnto the people, Ye can not serue the Lord: for he is an holie God: he is a ielous God: hee will not pardon your iniquitie nor your sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>If yee forsake the Lord and serue strange gods, then he will returne and bring euill vpon you, and consume you, after that hee hath done you good.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the people saide vnto Ioshua, Nay, but we will serue the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Ioshua saide vnto the people, Yee are witnesses against your selues, that yee haue chosen you the Lord, to serue him: and they sayd, We are witnesses.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then put away nowe, saide he, the strange gods which are among you, and bowe your hearts vnto the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And ye people saide vnto Ioshua, The Lord our God wil we serue, and his voyce wil we obey.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Ioshua made a couenant with the people the same day, and gaue them an ordinance and lawe in Shechem.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Ioshua wrote these woordes in the booke of the Lawe of God, and tooke a great stone, and pitched it there vnder an oke that was in the Sanctuarie of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Ioshua saide vnto all the people, Beholde, this stone shall be a witnesse vnto vs: for it hath heard all the wordes of the Lord which he spake with vs: it shall be therefore a witnesse against you, lest yee denie your God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Ioshua let the people depart, euery man vnto his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And after these things Ioshua the sonne of Nun, the seruaunt of the Lord died, being an hundreth and ten yeeres olde.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And they buried him in ye border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the Northside of mount Gaash.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Israel serued the Lord all the daies of Ioshua, and all the daies of the Elders that ouerliued Ioshua, and which had knowen all the workes of the Lord that he had done for Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the bones of Ioseph, which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in a parcell of ground which Iaakob bought of the sonnes of Hamor the father of Shechem, for an hundreth pieces of siluer, and the children of Ioseph had them in their inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Also Eleazar the sonne of Aaron died, whome they buried in the hill of Phinehas his sonne, which was giuen him in mount Ephraim. </div><ul class='tnav'>
