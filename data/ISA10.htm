Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Like as mine hand hath founde the kingdomes of the idoles, seeing their idoles were aboue Ierusalem, and aboue Samaria:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Shall not I, as I haue done to Samaria, and to the idoles thereof, so doe to Ierusalem and to the idoles thereof?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when the Lord hath accomplished all his worke vpon mount Zion and Ierusalem, I will visite the fruite of the proude heart of the King of Asshur, and his glorious and proud lookes,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Because he said, By ye power of mine owne hand haue I done it, and by my wisdome, because I am wise: therefore I haue remooued the borders of the people, and haue spoyled their treasures, and haue pulled downe the inhabitants like a valiant man.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And mine hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people, and as one gathereth egges that are left, so haue I gathered all the earth: and there was none to mooue the wing or to open the mouth, or to whisper.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Shall the axe boast it selfe against him that heweth therewith? or shall the sawe exalt it selfe against him that moueth it? as if the rod shoulde lift vp it selfe against him that taketh it vp, or the staffe should exalt it selfe, as it were no wood.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore shall the Lord God of hostes send amog his fat men, leannes, and vnder his glorie he shall kindle a burning, like the burning of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the light of Israel shalbe as a fire, and the Holy one thereof as a flame, and it shall burne, and deuoure his thornes and his briers in one day:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitfull fieldes both soule and flesh: and he shalbe as ye fainting of a standard bearer.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the rest of the trees of his forest shalbe fewe, that a childe may tell them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And at that day shall the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Iaakob, stay no more vpon him that smote them, but shall stay vpon ye Lord, ye Holy one of Israel in trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The remnant shall returne, euen the remnant of Iaakob vnto the mightie God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, yet shall the remnant of them returne. The consumption decreed shall ouerflow with righteousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the Lord God of hostes shall make the consumption, euen determined, in the middes of all the land.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith ye Lord God of hostes, O my people, that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of Asshur: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift vp his staffe against thee after the maner of Egypt:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But yet a very litle time, and the wrath shall be consumed, and mine anger in their destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And ye Lord of hostes shall raise vp a scourge for him, according to the plague of Midian in the rocke Oreb: and as his staffe was vpon the Sea, so he will lift it vp after the maner of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And at that day shall his burden be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy necke: and the yoke shalbe destroied because of the anoynting.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He is come to Aiath: he is passed into Migron: at Michmash shall he lay vp his armour.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They haue gone ouer the foorde: they lodged in the lodging at Geba: Ramah is afraide: Gibeah of Saul is fled away.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Lift vp thy voyce, O daughter Gallim, cause Laish to heare, O poore Anathoth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Madmenah is remoued: the inhabitants of Gebim haue gathered themselues together.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Yet there is a time that he will stay at Nob: he shall lift vp his hand towarde the mount of the daughter Zion, the hill of Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Beholde, the Lord God of hostes shall cut off the bough with feare, and they of high stature shalbe cut off, and the hie shalbe humbled.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he shall cut away the thicke places of the forest with yron, and Lebanon shall haue a mightie fall. </div><ul class='tnav'>
