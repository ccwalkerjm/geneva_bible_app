keepe the dedication and gladnes, both with thankesgiuings and with songs, cymbales, violes and with harpes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the singers gathered themselues together both from the plaine countrey about Ierusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And from the house of Gilgal, and out of the countreis of Geba, and Azmaueth: for the singers had built them villages round about Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the Priests and Leuites were purified, and clensed the people, and the gates, and the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I brought vp the princes of Iudah vpon the wall, and appointed two great companies to giue thankes, and the one went on the right hand of the wall toward the dung gate.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And after them went Hoshaiah, and halfe of the princes of Iudah,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Azariah, Ezra and Meshullam,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Iudah, Beniamin, and Shemaiah, and Ieremiah,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And of the Priests sonnes with trumpets,

id="V37">37&#160;</span>And to the gate of the fountaine, euen ouer against them went they vp by the staires of the citie of Dauid, at the going vp of the wall beyond the house of Dauid, euen vnto the water gate Eastward.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the seconde companie of them that gaue thankes, went on the other side, and I after them, and the halfe of the people was vpon the wall, and vpon the towre of the furnaces euen vnto the broad wall.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And vpon the gate of Ephraim, and vpon the olde gate, and vpon the fishgate, and the towre of Hananeel, and the towre of Meah, euen vnto the sheepegate: and they stood in the gate of the warde.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So stood the two companies (of them that gaue thankes) in the house of God, and I and the halfe of the rulers with me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The Priests also, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Vzzi, and Iehohanan, and Malchiiah, and Elam, and Ezer: and the singers sang loude, hauing Izrahiah which was the ouerseer.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And the same day they offered great sacrifices and reioyced: for God had giuen them great ioy, so that both the women, and the children were ioyfull: and the ioy of Ierusalem was heard farre off.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Also at the same time were men appointed ouer the chambers of the store for the offerings (for the first fruites, and for the tithes) to gather into them out of the fieldes of the cities, the portions of the Law for the Priests and the Leuites: for Iudah reioyced for the Priests and for the Leuites, that serued.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And both the singers and the Leuites kept the ward of their God, and the warde of the purification according to the commandement of Dauid, and Salomon his sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For in the dayes of Dauid and Asaph, of olde were chiefe singers, and songs of praise and thankesgiuing vnto God.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And in the dayes of Zerubbabel, and in the dayes of Nehemiah did al Israel giue portions vnto the singers and porters, euerie day his portion, and they gaue the holy things vnto the Leuites, and the Leuites gaue the holy things vnto the sonnes of Aaron. </div><ul class='tnav'>
