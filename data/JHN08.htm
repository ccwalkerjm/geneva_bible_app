<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Iesus went vnto the mount of Oliues,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And early in the morning came againe into the Temple, and all the people came vnto him, and he sate downe, and taught them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then the Scribes, and the Pharises brought vnto him a woman, taken in adulterie, and set her in the middes,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And said vnto him, Master, we foud this woman committing adulterie, euen in the very acte.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now Moses in our Law commanded, that such should be stoned: what sayest thou therefore?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And this they saide to tempt him, that they might haue, whereof to accuse him. But Iesus stouped downe, and with his finger wrote on the groud.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And while they continued asking him, hee lift himselfe vp, and sayde vnto them, Let him that is among you without sinne, cast the first stone at her.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And againe hee stouped downe, and wrote on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when they heard it, being accused by their owne conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at ye eldest euen to the last: so Iesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the mids.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When Iesus had lift vp himselfe againe, and sawe no man, but the woman, hee saide vnto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>She said, No man, Lord. And Iesus said, Neither do I condemne thee: go and sinne no more.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then spake Iesus againe vnto them, saying, I am that light of the worlde: hee that followeth mee, shall not walke in darkenes, but shall haue that light of life.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Pharises therefore saide vnto him, Thou bearest recorde of thy selfe: thy recorde is not true.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them, Though I beare recorde of my selfe, yet my recorde is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I goe.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Ye iudge after the flesh: I iudge no man.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if I also iudge, my iudgement is true: for I am not alone, but I, and the Father, that sent mee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it is also written in your Lawe, that the testimonie of two men is true.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I am one that beare witnes of my selfe, and the Father that sent me, beareth witnes of me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then saide they vnto him, Where is that Father of thine? Iesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor that Father of mine. If ye had knowen me, ye should haue knowen that Father of mine also.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>These wordes spake Iesus in the treasurie, as hee taught in the Temple, and no man layde handes on him: for his houre was not yet come.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then saide Iesus againe vnto them, I goe my way, and ye shall seeke me, and shall die in your sinnes, Whither I goe, can ye not come.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then said the Iewes, Will he kill himselfe, because he saith, Whither I goe, can ye not come?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And hee saide vnto them, Ye are from beneath, I am from aboue: ye are of this world, I am not of this worlde.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I said therefore vnto you, That ye shall die in your sinnes: for except ye beleeue, that I am he, ye shall die in your sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then saide they vnto him, Who art thou? And Iesus saide vnto them, Euen the same thing that I said vnto you from the beginning.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I haue many things to say, and to iudge of you: but he that sent me, is true, and the things that I haue heard of him, those speake I to the world.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They vnderstoode not that hee spake to them of the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then said Iesus vnto them, When ye haue lift vp the Sonne of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I doe nothing of my selfe, but as my Father hath taught me, so I speake these things.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For he that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone, because I do alwayes those things that please him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>As hee spake these thinges, many beleeued in him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then saide Iesus to the Iewes which beleeued in him, If ye continue in my worde, ye are verely my disciples,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And shall know the trueth, and the trueth shall make you free.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They answered him, Wee be Abrahams seede, and were neuer bonde to any man: why sayest thou then, Ye shalbe made free?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Iesus answered them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, that whosoeuer committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer: but the Sonne abideth for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>If that Sonne therefore shall make you free, ye shalbe free in deede.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>I know that ye are Abrahams seede, but yee seeke to kill mee, because my worde hath no place in you.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I speake that which I haue seene with my Father: and ye doe that which ye haue seene with your father.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They answered, and saide vnto him, Abraham is our father. Iesus said vnto them, If ye were Abrahams children, ye woulde doe the workes of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But nowe ye goe about to kill mee, a man that haue told you the trueth, which I haue heard of God: this did not Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Ye do the workes of your father. Then said they to him, We are not borne of fornication: we haue one Father, which is God.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Therefore Iesus sayde vnto them, If God were your Father, then woulde ye loue mee: for I proceeded foorth, and came from God, neither came I of my selfe, but he sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Why doe ye not vnderstande my talke? because ye cannot heare my worde.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Ye are of your father the deuill, and the lustes of your father ye will doe: hee hath bene a murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the trueth, because there is no trueth in him. When hee speaketh a lie, then speaketh hee of his owne: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And because I tell you the trueth, yee beleeue me not.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Which of you can rebuke me of sinne? and if I say the trueth, why do ye not beleeue me?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He that is of God, heareth Gods wordes: yee therefore heare them not, because ye are not of God.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Then answered the Iewes, and said vnto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritane, and hast a deuil?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Iesus answered, I haue not a deuil, but I honour my Father, and ye haue dishonoured me.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And I seeke not mine owne praise: but there is one that seeketh it, and iudgeth.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Verely, verely I say vnto you, If a man keepe my word, he shall neuer see death.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then said the Iewes to him, Now know we that thou hast a deuill. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets: and thou sayest, If a man keepe my worde, he shall neuer taste of death.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which is dead? and the Prophets are dead: whome makest thou thy selfe?  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Iesus answered, If I honour my selfe, mine honour is nothing worth: it is my Father that honoureth me, whome ye say, that hee is your God.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Yet ye haue not knowen him: but I knowe him, and if I should say I know him not, I should be a liar like vnto you: but I knowe him, and keepe his worde.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Your father Abraham reioyced to see my day, and he sawe it, and was glad.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Then sayd ye Iewes vnto him, Thou art not yet fiftie yeere olde, and hast thou seene Abraham?  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Iesus sayd vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, before Abraham was, I am.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>Then tooke they vp stones, to cast at him, but Iesus hid himselfe, and went out of the Temple: And hee passed through the middes of them, and so went his way. </div><ul class='tnav'>
