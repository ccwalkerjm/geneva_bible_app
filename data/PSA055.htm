Heare my prayer, O God, and hide not thy selfe from my supplication.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Hearken vnto me, and answere me: I mourne in my prayer, and make a noyse,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the voyce of the enemie, and for the vexation of ye wicked, because they haue brought iniquitie vpon me, and furiously hate me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Mine heart trembleth within mee, and the terrours of death are fallen vpon me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Feare and trembling are come vpon mee, and an horrible feare hath couered me.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I said, Oh that I had wings like a doue: then would I flie away and rest.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Beholde, I woulde take my flight farre off, and lodge in the wildernes. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Hee would make haste for my deliuerance from the stormie winde and tempest.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Destroy, O Lord, and deuide their tongues: for I haue seene crueltie and strife in the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Day and night they goe about it vpon the walles thereof: both iniquitie and mischiefe are in the middes of it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wickednes is in the middes thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streetes.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Surely mine enemie did not defame mee: for I could haue borne it: neither did mine aduersarie exalt himselfe against mee: for I would haue hid me from him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But it was thou, O man, euen my companion, my guide and my familiar:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Which delited in consulting together, and went into the House of God as companions.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let death sense vpon them: let them goe downe quicke into the graue: for wickednes is in their dwellings, euen in the middes of them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But I will call vnto God, and the Lord will saue me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Euening and morning, and at noone will I pray, and make a noyse, and he wil heare my voice.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He hath deliuered my soule in peace from the battel, that was against me: for many were with me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God shall heare and afflict them, euen hee that reigneth of olde, Selah. because they haue no changes, therefore they feare not God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Hee layed his hande vpon such, as be at peace with him, and he brake his couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The wordes of his mouth were softer then butter, yet warre was in his heart: his words were more gentle then oyle, yet they were swordes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Cast thy burden vpon the Lord, and hee shall nourish thee: he wil not suffer the righteous to fall for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And thou, O God, shalt bring them downe into the pitte of corruption: the bloudie, and deceitfull men shall not liue halfe their dayes: but I will trust in thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
