<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now was there one Naaman captaine of the hoste of the King of Aram, a great man, and honourable in the sight of his lorde, because that by him the Lord had deliuered the Aramites. He also was a mightie man and valiant, but a leper.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the Aramites had gone out by bands, and had taken a litle mayde of the land of Israel, and shee serued Naamans wife.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And she sayd vnto her mistres, Would God my lord were with the Prophet that is in Samaria, he would soone deliuer him of his leprosie.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he went in, and tolde his lorde, saying, Thus and thus saith the mayde that is of the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the King of Aram sayde, Goe thy way thither, and I will send a letter vnto the King of Israel. And he departed, and tooke with him ten talents of siluer, and sixe thousand pieces of golde, and ten change of rayments,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And brought the letter to the King of Israel to this effect, Now when this letter is come vnto thee, vnderstand, that I haue sent thee Naaman my seruant, that thou maiest heale him of his leprosie.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when the King of Israel had read the letter, he rent his clothes, and sayde, Am I God, to kill and to giue life, that hee doth send to mee, that I should heale a man from his leprosie? wherfore consider, I pray you, and see howe he seeketh a quarel against me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But when Elisha the man of God had heard that the King of Israel had rent his clothes, hee sent vnto the King, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall knowe that there is a Prophet in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Naaman came with his horses, and with his charets, and stoode at the doore of the house of Elisha.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Elisha sent a messenger vnto him, saying, Go and wash thee in Iorden seuen times, and thy flesh shall come againe to thee, and thou shalt be clensed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Naaman was wroth and went away, and sayde, Beholde, I thought with my selfe, Hee will surely come out, and stande, and call on the Name of the Lord his God and put his hand on the place, and heale the leprosie.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Are not Abanah and Pharpar, riuers of Damascus, better then all the waters of Israel? may I not washe mee in them, and bee cleansed? so hee turned, and departed in displeasure.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But his seruants came, and spake vnto him, and sayd, Father, if the Prophet had commanded thee a great thing, wouldest thou not haue done it? howe much rather then, when hee sayth to thee, Wash and be cleane?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then went he downe, and washed him selfe seuen times in Iorden, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came againe, like vnto ye flesh of a litle child, and he was cleane.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And hee turned againe to the man of God, hee, and all his companie, and came and stood before him, and sayd, Behold, now I knowe that there is no God in all the world, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a reward of thy seruant.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But hee sayde, As the Lord liueth (before whom I stand) I wil not receiue it. And he would haue constrained him to receiue it, but he refused.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moreouer Naaman sayde, Shall there not be giuen to thy seruant two mules loade of this earth? for thy seruant will henceforth offer neither burnt sacrifice nor offring vnto any other god, saue vnto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Herein the Lord bee mercifull vnto thy seruant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon, to worship there, and leaneth on mine hand, and I bowe my selfe in the house of Rimmon: when I doe bowe downe, I say, in the house of Rimmon, the Lord be mercifull vnto thy seruant in this point.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Vnto whome he saide, Goe in peace. So he departed from him about halfe a dayes iourney of grounde.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Gehazi the seruant of Elisha the man of God sayde, Beholde, my master hath spared this Aramite Naaman, receiuing not those things at his hand that he brought: as the Lord liueth, I will runne after him, and take somewhat of him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Gehazi followed speedily after Naaman. And when Naaman sawe him running after him, he light downe from the charet to meete him, and said, Is all well?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he answered, All is well: my master hath set me, saying, Behold, there be come to me, euen nowe from mount Ephraim two yong men of the children of the Prophets: giue them, I pray thee, a talent of siluer, and two change of garmets.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Naaman saide, Yea, take two talents: and he compelled him, and bound two talents of siluer in two bagges, with two change of garments, and gaue them vnto two of his seruants, that they might beare them before him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when he came to the towre, he tooke them out of their handes, and laide them in the house, and sent away the men: and they departed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then he went in, and stoode before his master. And Elisha said vnto him, Whence commest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy seruant went no whither.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But he saide vnto him, Went not mine heart with thee when the man turned againe from his charet to meete thee? Is this a time to take money, and to receiue garments, and oliues, and vineyardes, and sheepe, and oxen, and men seruants, and maide seruants?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The leprosie therefore of Naaman shall cleaue vnto thee, and to thy seede for euer. And he went out from his presence a leper white as snowe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
