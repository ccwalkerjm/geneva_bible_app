And he commanded the Priests the sonnes of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So they slewe the bullockes, and the Priests receiued the blood, and sprinkled it vpon the altar: they slew also the rammes and sprinkled the blood vpon the altar, and they slew the lambes, and they sprinkled the blood vpon the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then they brought the hee goates for the sinne offring before the King and the Congregation, and they layde their hands vpon them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the Priests slewe them, and with the blood of them they clensed the altar to reconcile all Israel: for the King had commanded for all Israel the burnt offring and the sinne offring.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He appointed also the Leuites in the house of the Lord with cymbales, with violes, and with harpes, according to the commandement of Dauid, and Gad the Kings Seer, and Nathan the Prophet: for the commandement was by the hande of the Lord, and by the hande of his Prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Leuites stood with the instruments of Dauid, and the Priests with the trumpets.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offring vpon the altar: and when the burnt offring began, the song of the Lord beganne with the trumpets, and the instruments of Dauid King of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And al the Congregation worshipped, singing a song, and they blew the trumpets: all this continued vntill the burnt offring was finished.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when they had made an ende of offring, the King and all that were present with him, bowed themselues, and worshipped.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Hezekiah the King and the princes commanded the Leuites to prayse the Lord with the wordes of Dauid, and of Asaph the Seer. so they praysed with ioy, and they bowed themselues, and worshipped.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Hezekiah spake, and sayde, Now ye haue consecrate your selues to the Lord: come neere and bring the sacrifices and offerings of prayse into the house of the Lord. And the Congregation brought sacrifices; and offrings of prayses, and euery man that was willing in heart, offred burnt offrings.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the nomber of the burnt offrings, which the Congregation brought, was seuentie bullockes, an hundreth rammes, and two hundreth lambes: all these were for a burnt offring to the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And for sanctification sixe hundreth bullockes, and three thousand sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the Priests were too few, and were not able to flay all the burnt offrings: therefore their brethren the Leuites did helpe them, til they had ended the worke, and vntill other Priests were sanctified: for the Leuites were more vpright in heart to sanctifie themselues, then the Priests.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And also the burnt offerings were many with the fat of the peace offrings and the drinke offrings for the burnt offring. so the seruice of the house of the Lord was set in order.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then Hezekiah reioyced and all the people, that God had made the people so ready: for the thing was done suddenly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
