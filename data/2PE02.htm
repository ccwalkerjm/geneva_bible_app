Spottes they are and blottes, deliting them selues in their deceiuings, in feasting with you,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Hauing eyes full of adulterie, and that can not cease to sinne, beguiling vnstable soules: they haue heartes exercised with couetousnesse, they are the children of curse:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Which forsaking the right way, haue gone astray, folowing the way of Balaam, the sonne of Bosor, which loued the wages of vnrighteousnes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But he was rebuked for his iniquitie: for the dumme beast speaking with mans voyce, forbade the foolishnesse of the Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>These are welles without water, and cloudes caried about with a tempest, to whome the blacke darkenes is reserued for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For in speaking swelling wordes of vanitie, they beguile with wantonnesse through the lusts of the flesh them that were cleane escaped from them which are wrapped in errour,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Promising vnto them libertie, and are themselues the seruants of corruption: for of whomsoeuer a man is ouercome, euen vnto the same is he in bondage.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For if they, after they haue escaped from the filthinesse of the world, through the acknowledging of the Lord, and of the Sauiour Iesus Christ, are yet tangled againe therein, and ouercome, the latter ende is worse with them then the beginning.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For it had bene better for them, not to haue acknowledged the way of righteousnes, then after they haue acknowledged it, to turne from the holy commandement giuen vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But it is come vnto them, according to the true Prouerbe, The dogge is returned to his owne vomit: and, The sowe that was washed, to the wallowing in the myre. </div><ul class='tnav'>
