It shall be no more, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou therefore, sonne of man, prophecie, and smite hand to hand, and let the sworde be doubled: let the sworde that hath killed, returne the third time: it is the sword of the great slaughter entring into their priuie chambers.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I haue brought the feare of the sword into all their gates to make their heart to faint, and to multiplie their ruines. Ah it is made bright, and it is dressed for the slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Get thee alone: goe to the right hande, or get thy selfe to the left hande, whithersoeuer thy face turneth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I wil also smite mine hands together, and wil cause my wrath to cease. I the Lord haue said it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The worde of the Lord came vnto mee againe, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Also thou sonne of man, appoint thee two wayes, that the sworde of the King of Babel may come: both twaine shall come out of one lande, and chuse a place, and chuse it in the corner of the way of the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Appoint a way, that the sworde may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Iudah in Ierusalem the strong citie.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the King of Babel stoode at the parting of the way, at the head of the two wayes, consulting by diuination, and made his arrowes bright: hee consulted with idoles, and looked in the liuer.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>At his right hand was the diuination for Ierusalem to appoint captaines, to open their mouth in the slaughter, and to lift vp their voyce with shouting, to laye engines of warre against the gates, to cast a mount, and to builde a fortresse.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it shalbe vnto them as a false diuination in their sight for the othes made vnto them: but hee will call to remembrance their iniquitie, to the intent they should be taken.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore thus sayeth the Lord God, Because ye haue made your iniquitie to bee remembred, in discouering your rebellion, that in al your workes your sinnes might appeare: because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And thou prince of Israel polluted, and wicked, whose day is come, when iniquitie shall haue an ende,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God, I will take away the diademe, and take off the crowne: this shalbe no more the same: I wil exalt the humble, and will abase him that is hie.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I wil ouerturne, ouerturne, ouerturne it, and it shall be no more vntill he come, whose right it is, and I will giue it him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And thou, sonne of man, prophecie, and say, Thus saith the Lord God to the children of Ammon, and to their blasphemie: say thou, I say, The sword, the sword is drawen foorth, and fourbished to the slaughter, to consume, because of the glittering:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Whiles they see vanitie vnto thee, and prophecied a lie vnto thee to bring thee vpon the neckes of the wicked that are slaine, whose day is come when their iniquitie shall haue an ende.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Shall I cause it to returne into his sheath? I will iudge thee in the place where thou wast created, euen in the land of thine habitation.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I wil powre out mine indignation vpon thee, and will blowe against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliuer thee into the hand of beastly men, and skilfull to destroy.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thou shalt bee in the fire to be deuoured: thy blood shall be in the middes of the lande, and thou shalt be no more remembred: for I the Lord haue spoken it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
