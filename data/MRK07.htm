Doe ye not knowe that whatsoeuer thing from without entreth into a man, cannot defile him,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Because it entreth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught which is the purging of all meates?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then he sayd, That which commeth out of man, that defileth man.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For from within, euen out of the heart of men, proceede euill thoughtes, adulteries, fornications, murthers,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Theftes, couetousnes, wickednes, deceite, vncleannes, a wicked eye, backbiting, pride, foolishnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All these euill things come from within, and defile a man.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And from thence he rose, and went into the borders of Tyrus and Sidon, and entred into an house, and woulde that no man should haue knowen: but he could not be hid.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For a certaine woman, whose litle daughter had an vncleane spirit, heard of him, and came, and fell at his feete,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>(And the woman was a Greeke, a Syrophenissian by nation) and she besought him that he would cast out the deuill out of her daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Iesus saide vnto her, Let the children first be fedde: for it is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast it vnto whelpes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then shee answered, and saide vnto him, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the whelpes eate vnder the table of the childrens crommes.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then he said vnto her, For this saying goe thy way: the deuil is gone out of thy daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when shee was come home to her house, shee founde the deuill departed, and her daughter lying on the bed.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And hee departed againe from the coastes of Tyrus and Sidon, and came vnto the sea of Galile, through the middes of the coastes of Decapolis.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they brought vnto him one that was deafe and stambered in his speache, and prayed him to put his hand vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then hee tooke him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers in his eares, and did spit, and touched his tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And looking vp to heauen, hee sighed, and said vnto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And straightway his eares were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and hee spake plaine.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he commanded them, that they should tell no man: but howe much soeuer hee forbad them, the more a great deale they published it,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And were beyonde measure astonied, saying, Hee hath done all thinges well: he maketh both the deafe to heare, and the domme to speake. </div><ul class='tnav'>
