<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After, the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, Feare not, neither bee thou faint hearted: take all the men of warre with thee and arise, go vp to Ai: beholde, I haue giuen into thine hand the King of Ai, and his people, and his citie, and his land.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And thou shalt doe to Ai and to the King thereof, as thou didst vnto Iericho and to the King thereof: neuerthelesse the spoyle thereof and the cattell thereof shall ye take vnto you for a praye: thou shalt lye in wait against the citie on the backside thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Ioshua arose, and all the men of warre to goe vp against Ai: and Ioshua chose out thirtie thousand strong men, and valiant, and sent them away by night.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he commanded them, saying, Behold, yee shall lye in waite against the citie on the backeside of the citie: goe not very farre from the citie, but be ye all in a readinesse.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I and all the people that are with me, will approche vnto the citie: and when they shall come out against vs, as they did at the first time, then will we flee before them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For they wil come out after vs, till we haue brought them out of the citie: for they will say, They flee before vs as at the first time: so we will flee before them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then you shall rise vp from lying in waite and destroy the citie: for the Lord your God wil deliuer it into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when ye haue taken the citie, ye shall set it on fire: according to the commandement of the Lord shall ye do: behold, I haue charged you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ioshua then sent them foorth, and they went to lye in waite, and abode betweene Beth-el and Ai, on the Westside of Ai: but Ioshua lodged that night among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Ioshua rose vp early in the morning, and nombred the people: and he and the Elders of Israel went vp before the people against Ai.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Also all the men of warre that were with him went vp and drewe neere, and came against the citie, and pitched on the Northside of Ai: and there was a valley betweene them and Ai.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And hee tooke about fiue thousande men, and set them to lye in waite betweene Beth-el and Ai, on the Westside of the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the people set all the hoste that was on the Northside against the citie, and the liers in waite on the West, against the citie: and Ioshua went the same night into the mids of the valley.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when the King of Ai sawe it, then the men of the citie hasted and rose vp earely, and went out against Israel to battell, hee and all his people at the time appointed, before the plaine: for he knew not that any lay in waite against him on the backeside of the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Ioshua and all Israel as beaten before them, fled by the way of the wildernes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And all the people of the citie were called together, to pursue after them: and they pursued after Ioshua, and were drawen away out of the city,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So that there was not a man left in Ai, nor in Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the citie open, and pursued after Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Stretch out the speare that is in thine hande, towarde Ai: for I wil giue it into thine hand: and Ioshua stretched out the speare that hee had in his hand, toward the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they that lay in wait, arose quickly out of their place, and ranne as soone as he had stretched out his hand, and they entred into the citie, and tooke it, and hasted, and set the citie on fire.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the men of Ai looked behinde them, and sawe it: for loe, the smoke of the citie ascended vp to heauen, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: for the people that fled to the wildernesse, turned backe vpon the pursuers.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When Ioshua and all Israel sawe that they that lay in waite, had taken the citie, and that the smoke of the citie mounted vp, then they turned againe and slewe the men of Ai.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Also the other issued out of the citie against them: so were they in the middes of Israel, these being on the one side, and the rest on the other side: and they slewe them, so that they let none of them remaine nor escape.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the King of Ai they tooke aliue, and brought him to Ioshua.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when Israel had made an ende of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the fielde, that is, in the wildernesse, where they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sworde, vntill they were consumed, all the Israelites returned vnto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelue thousande, euen all the men of Ai.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For Ioshua drewe not his hande backe againe which he had stretched out with the speare, vntill hee had vtterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Onely the cattell and the spoyle of this citie, Israel tooke for a praye vnto themselues, according vnto the worde of the Lord, which hee commanded Ioshua.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Ioshua burnt Ai, and made it an heape for euer, and a wildernes vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the King of Ai hee hanged on a tree, vnto the euening. And as soone as the sunne was down, Ioshua commanded that they should take his carkeis downe from the tree, and cast it at the entring of ye gate of the city, and lay thereon a great heape of stones, that remaineth vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Ioshua built an altar vnto the Lord God of Israel, in mount Ebal,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>As Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the booke of the Lawe of Moses, an altar of whole stone, ouer which no man had lift an yron: and they offered thereon burnt offrings vnto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Also he wrote there vpon the stones, a rehearsall of the Lawe of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And all Israel (and their Elders, and officers and their iudges stoode on this side of the Arke, and on that side, before the Priestes of the Leuites, which bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lord) as well the stranger, as he that is borne in the countrey: halfe of them were ouer against mount Gerizim, and halfe of them ouer against mount Ebal, as Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should blesse the people of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then afterwarde hee read all the wordes of the Lawe, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the booke of the Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>There was not a worde of all that Moses had commanded, which Ioshua read not before all the Congregation of Israel, as well before the women and the children, as the stranger that was conuersant among them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
