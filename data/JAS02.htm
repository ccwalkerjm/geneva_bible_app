Doe not the riche oppresse you by tyrannie, and doe not they drawe you before the iudgement seates?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Doe nor they blaspheme the worthie Name after which yee be named?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But if yee fulfill the royall Lawe according to the Scripture, which saith, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, yee doe well.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But if yee regarde the persons, yee commit sinne, and are rebuked of the Lawe, as transgressours.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For whosoeuer shall keepe the whole Lawe, and yet faileth in one poynt, hee is guiltie of all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he that saide, Thou shalt not commit adulterie, saide also, Thou shalt not kill. Nowe though thou doest none adulterie, yet if thou killest, thou art a transgressour of the Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So speake ye, and so doe, as they that shall be iudged by the Lawe of libertie.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For there shalbe condemnation merciles to him that sheweth not mercie, and mercie reioyceth against condemnation.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>What auaileth it, my brethren, though a man saith he hath faith, when he hath no workes? can that faith saue him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if a brother or a sister bee naked and destitute of daily foode,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And one of you say vnto them, Depart in peace: warme your selues, and fil your bellies, notwithstading ye giue them not those things which are needefull to the body, what helpeth it?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Euen so the faith, if it haue no woorkes, is dead in it selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But some man might say, Thou hast the faith, and I haue woorkes: shewe me thy faith out of thy woorkes, and I will shewe thee my faith by my woorkes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou beleeuest that there is one God: thou doest well: the deuils also beleeue it, and tremble.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But wilt thou vnderstand, O thou vaine man, that the faith which is without workes, is dead?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Was not Abraham our father iustified through workes, when he offred Isaac his sonne vpon the altar?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Seest thou not that the faith wrought with his workes? and through the workes was the faith made perfect.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Scripture was fulfilled which sayeth, Abraham beleeued God, and it was imputed vnto him for righteousnesse: and hee was called the friende of God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ye see then howe that of workes a man is iustified, and not of faith onely.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot iustified through workes, when she had receiued ye messengers, and sent them out another way?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as the body without ye spirit is dead, euen so the faith without workes is dead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
