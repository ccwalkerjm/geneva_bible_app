An hundreth and thirtie yeere olde was he when he dyed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they buried him in the citie of Dauid with the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And after the death of Iehoiada, came the princes of Iudah, and did reuerence to the King, and the King hearkened vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and serued groues and idoles: and wrath came vpon Iudah and Ierusalem, because of this their trespasse.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And God sent Prophets amog the, to bring them againe vnto the Lord: and they made protestation among them, but they would not heare.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Spirit of God came vpon Zechariah the sonne of Iehoiada the Priest, which stoode aboue the people, and sayde vnto them, Thus sayth God, Why transgresse ye the commandements of the Lord? surely ye shall not prosper: because ye haue forsaken the Lord, he also hath forsaken you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandement of the King, in the court of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus Ioash the King remembred not the kindnesse which Iehoiada his father had done to him, but slewe his sonne. And when he dyed, he sayd, The Lord looke vpon it, and require it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when the yeere was out, the host of Aram came vp against him, and they came against Iudah and Ierusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoyle of them vnto the King of Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Though the armie of Aram came with a small company of men, yet the Lord deliuered a very great armie into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers: and they gaue sentence against Ioash.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases) his owne seruants conspired against him for the blood of the children of Iehoiada the Priest, and slewe him on his bed, and he dyed, and they buryed him in the citie of Dauid: but they buryed him not in the sepulchres of the Kings.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And these are they that conspired against him, Zabad the sonne of Shimrath an Ammonitesse, and Iehozabad the sonne of Shimrith a Moabitesse.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But his sonnes, and the summe of the taxe gathered by him, and the foundation of the house of God, behold, they are written in the storie of the booke of the Kings. And Amaziah his sonne reigned in his steade. </div><ul class='tnav'>
