And he shall say, None. Then shall he say, Holde thy tongue: for we may not remember the Name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For behold, the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the litle house with clefts.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Shal horses runne vpon the rocke? or wil one plowe there with oxen? for yee haue turned iudgement into gall, and the fruite of righteousnes into wormewood.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Ye reioyce in a thing of nought: yee say, Haue not wee gotten vs hornes by our owne strength?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But behold, I wil raise vp against you a nation, O house of Israel, sayeth the Lord God of hostes: and they shall afflict you, from the entring in of Hamath vnto the riuer of the wildernes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
