And he answered, Nothing, but in any wise let me goe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And God stirred him vp another aduersarie, Rezon the sonne of Eliada, which fled from his lorde Hadadezer King of Zobah.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he gathered men vnto him, and had bene captaine ouer the company, when Dauid slew them. And they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and they made him King in Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore was he an aduersarie to Israel all the daies of Salomon: besides the euil that Hadad did, he also abhorred Israel, and reigned ouer Aram  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat an Ephrathite of Zereda Salomons seruant (whose mother was called Zeruah a widowe) lift vp his hand against the King.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And this was the cause that he lift vp his hande against the King, When Salomon built Millo, he repared the broken places of the citie of Dauid his father.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And this man Ieroboam was a man of strength and courage, and Salomon seeing that the yong man was meete for the worke, he made him ouerseer of all the labour of the house of Ioseph.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And at that time, when Ieroboam went out of Ierusalem, the Prophet Ahiiah the Shilonite founde him in the way, hauing a newe garment on him, and they two were alone in ye field.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Ahiiah caught the newe garment that was on him, and rent it in twelue pieces,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And said to Ieroboam, Take vnto thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Beholde, I wil rent the kingdome out of ye hands of Salomon, and will giue ten tribes to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But he shall haue one tribe for my seruant Dauids sake, and for Ierusalem the citie, which I haue chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Because they haue forsaken me, and haue worshipped Ashtaroth the god of the Zidonians, and Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and haue not walked in my wayes (to do right in mine eyes, and my statutes, and my lawes) as did Dauid his father.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But I will not take the whole kingdome out of his hande: for I will make him prince all his life long for Dauid my seruants sake, whome I haue chosen, and who kept my commandements and my statutes.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But I will take the kingdome out of his sonnes hand, and will giue it vnto thee, euen the ten tribes.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And vnto his sonne will I giue one tribe, that Dauid my seruant may haue a light alway before me in Ierusalem the citie, which I haue chosen me, to put my Name there.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And I wil take thee, and thou shalt reigne, euen as thine heart desireth, and shalt be King ouer Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And if thou hearken vnto all that I commande thee, and wilt walke in my wayes, and doe right in my sight, to keepe my statutes and my commandements, as Dauid my seruant did, then will I be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built vnto Dauid, and wil giue Israel vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And I will for this afflict the seede of Dauid, but not for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Salomon sought therefore to kill Ieroboam, and Ieroboam arose, and fled into Egypt vnto Shishak King of Egypt, and was in Egypt vntil the death of Salomon.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And the rest of the wordes of Salomon, and all that he did, and his wisedom, are they not written in the booke of the actes of Salomon?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The time that Salomon reigned in Ierusalem ouer all Israel, was fourtie yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Salomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the citie of Dauid his father: and Rehoboam his sonne reigned in his steade. </div><ul class='tnav'>
