And when hee had sayde this worde vnto me, I stood trembling.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then sayd he vnto me, Feare not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou diddest set thine heart to vnderstand, and to humble thy selfe before thy God, thy wordes were heard, and I am come for thy wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the prince of the kingdome of Persia withstoode me one and twentie dayes: but loe, Michael one of the chiefe princes, came to helpe me, and I remained there by the Kings of Persia.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nowe I am come to shewe thee what shall come to thy people in the latter dayes: for yet the vision is for many dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when he spake these wordes vnto me, I set my face towarde the grounde, and helde my tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And beholde, one like the similitude of the sonnes of man touched my lippes: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said vnto him that stoode before me, O my Lord, by the vision my sorowes are returned vpon me, and I haue reteined no strength.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For howe can the seruant of this my Lord talke with my Lord being such one? for as for me, straight way there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then there came againe, and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And said, O man, greatly beloued, feare not: peace be vnto thee: be strong and of good courage. And when he had spoken vnto me, I was strengthened, and saide, Let my Lord speake: for thou hast strengthened me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then saide he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come vnto thee? but nowe will I returne to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, loe, the prince of Grecia shall come.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But I will shew thee that which is decreeed in the Scripture of trueth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince. </div><ul class='tnav'>
