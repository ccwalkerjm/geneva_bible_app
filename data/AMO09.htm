Neuerthelesse I will not vtterly destroy the house of Iaakob, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For loe, I will command and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corne is sifted in a sieue: yet shall not the least stone fall vpon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But all the sinners of my people shall dye by the sword, which say, The euill shall not come, nor hasten for vs.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In that day will I raise vp the tabernacle of Dauid, that is fallen downe, and close vp the breaches therof, and I will rayse vp his ruines, and I will builde it, as in the dayes of olde,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>That they may possesse the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, because my Name is called vpon them, sayeth the Lord, that doeth this.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall touche the mower, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seede: and the mountaines shall drop sweete wine, and all the hilles shall melt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will bring againe the captiuitie of my people of Israel: and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabite the, and they shall plant vineyardes, and drinke the wine thereof: they shall also make gardens, and eate the fruites of them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I wil plant them vpon their land, and they shall no more bee pulled vp againe out of their lande, which I haue giuen them, sayeth the Lord thy God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
