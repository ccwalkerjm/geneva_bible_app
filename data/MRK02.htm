And he arose and followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to passe, as Iesus sate at table in his house, many Publicanes and sinners sate at table also with Iesus, and his disciples: for there were many that followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when the Scribes and Pharises sawe him eate with the Publicanes and sinners, they sayd vnto his disciples, Howe is it, that hee eateth and drinketh with Publicanes and sinners?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now when Iesus heard it, hee sayde vnto them, The whole haue no neede of the Physicion, but the sicke.
