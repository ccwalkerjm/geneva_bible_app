I will send my beloued sonne: it may be that they will doe reuerence, when they see him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But when the husbandmen sawe him, they reasoned with themselues, saying, This is the heire: come, let vs kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So they cast him out of the vineyarde, and killed him. What shall the Lord of the vineyarde therefore doe vnto them?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and wil giue out his vineyard to others. But when they heard it, they sayd, God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he beheld them, and said, What meaneth this then that is written, The stone that the builders refused, that is made the head of the corner?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whosoeuer shall fall vpon that stone, shall be broken: and on whomsoeuer it shall fall, it will grinde him to pouder.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then the hie Priests, and the Scribes the same houre went about to lay hands on him: (but they feared the people) for they perceiued that he had spoken this parable against them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should faine themselues iust men, to take him in his talke, and to deliuer him vnto the power and authoritie of the gouernour.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest, and teachest right, neither doest thou accept mans person, but teachest the way of God truely.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Is it lawfull for vs to giue Cesar tribute or no?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he perceiued their craftines, and sayd vnto them, Why tempt ye me?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Shew me a penie. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered, and sayd, Cesars.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then he sayd vnto them, Giue then vnto Cesar the things which are Cesars, and to God those which are Gods.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they could not reproue his saying before the people: but they marueiled at his answere, and helde their peace.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then came to him certaine of the Sadduces (which denie that there is any resurrection) and they asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Saying, Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die hauing a wife, and hee die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise vp seede vnto his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Now there were seuen brethren, and the first tooke a wife, and he dyed without children.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the second tooke the wife, and he dyed childelesse.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then the third tooke her: and so likewise the seuen dyed, and left no children.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And last of all the woman dyed also.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore at the resurrection, whose wife of them shall she be? for seuen had her to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, The children of this world marry wiues, and are married.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But they which shalbe counted worthy to enioy that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry wiues, neither are married.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For they can die no more, forasmuch as they are equall vnto the Angels, and are the sonnes of God, since they are the children of the resurrection.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And that the dead shall rise againe, euen Moses shewed it besides the bush, when he said, The Lord is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For he is not the God of the dead, but of them which liue: for all liue vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then certaine of the Scribes answered, and sayd, Master, thou hast well sayd.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And after that, durst they not aske him any thing at all.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then sayd he vnto them, Howe say they that Christ is Dauids sonne?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Dauid himselfe sayth in the booke of the Psalmes, The Lord sayd vnto my Lord, Sit at my right hand,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Till I shall make thine enemies thy footestoole.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Seeing Dauid called him Lord, howe is he then his sonne?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then in the audience of all the people he sayd vnto his disciples,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Beware of the Scribes, which willingly go in long robes, and loue salutations in the markets, and the highest seates in the assemblies, and the chiefe roomes at feastes:  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Which deuoure widowes houses, and in shewe make long prayers: These shall receiue greater damnation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
