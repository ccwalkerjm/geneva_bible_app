<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now after this so it was, that Absalom the sonne of Dauid hauing a fayre sister, whose name was Tamar, Amnon the sonne of Dauid loued her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Amnon was so sore vexed, that he fell sicke for his sister Tamar: for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to doe any thing to her.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But Amnon had a friend called Ionadab, the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother: and Ionadab was a very subtile man.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who sayde vnto him, Why art thou the Kings sonne so leane from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? Then Amnon answered him, I loue Tamar my brother Absaloms sister.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Ionadab sayd vnto him, Lie downe on thy bed, and make thy selfe sicke: and when thy father shall come to see thee, say vnto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and giue me meate, and let her dresse meate in my sight, that I may see it, and eate it of her hand.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Amnon lay downe, and made himselfe sicke: and when the King came to see him, Amnon sayde vnto the King, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may receiue meate at her hand.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Dauid sent home to Tamar, saying, Goe now to thy brother Amnons house, and dresse him meate.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house, and he lay downe: and she tooke floure, and knead it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And she tooke a pan, and powred them out before him, but he would not eat. Then Amnon saide, Cause ye euery man to goe out from me: so euery man went out from him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Amnon said vnto Tamar, Bring the meate into the chamber, that I may eate of thine hand. And Tamar tooke the cakes which shee had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when she had set them before him to eate, he tooke her, and sayd vnto her, Come, lye with me, my sister.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But shee answered him, Nay, my brother, doe not force me: for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: commit not this follie.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I, whither shall I cause my shame to goe? and thou shalt be as one of the fooles in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, speake to the King, for he will not denie me vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Howbeit he would not hearken vnto her voyce, but being stronger then she, forced her, and lay with her.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred wherewith he hated her, was greater then the loue, wherewith hee had loued her: and Amnon sayde vnto her, Vp, get thee hence.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she answered him, There is no cause: this euill (to put mee away) is greater then the other that thou diddest vnto me: but he would not heare her,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But called his seruant that serued him, and sayd, Put this woman now out from me, and locke the doore after her.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>(And she had a garment of diuers coulours vpon her: for with such garments were the Kings daughters that were virgins, apparelled) Then his seruant brought her out, and locked the doore after her.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent the garment of diuers colours which was on her, and layde her hand on her head, and went her way crying.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Absalom her brother sayd vnto her, Hath Amnon thy brother bene with thee? Now yet be still, my sister: he is thy brother: let not this thing grieue thine heart. So Tamar remayned desolate in her brother Absaloms house.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But when King Dauid heard all these things, he was very wroth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Absalom sayde vnto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And after the time of two yeeres, Absalom had sheepesherers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim, and Absalom called all the Kings sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Absalom came to the King and sayd, Beholde now, thy seruant hath sheepesherers: I pray thee, that the King with his seruants would goe with thy seruant.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But the King answered Absalom, Nay my sonne, I pray thee, let vs not goe all, lest we be chargeable vnto thee. Yet Absalom lay sore vpon him: howbeit he would not go, but thanked him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then sayd Absalom, But, I pray thee, shall not my brother Amnon goe with vs? And the king answered him, Why should he go with thee?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Absalom was instant vpon him, and he sent Amnon with him, and all the Kings children.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now had Absalom commanded his seruants, saying, Marke now when Amnons heart is merry with wine, and when I say vnto you, Smite Amnon, kill him, feare not, for haue not I commanded you? be bold therefore, and play the men.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the seruantes of Absalom did vnto Amnon, as Absalom had commanded: and al the Kings sonnes arose, and euery man gate him vp vpon his mule, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And while they were in the way, tydings came to Dauid, saying, Absalom hath slaine al the Kings sonnes, and there is not one of them left.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then the King arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the ground, and all his seruants stoode by with their clothes rent.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Ionadab the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother answered and sayde, Let not my lord suppose that they haue slayne all the yong men the Kings sonnes: for Amnon onely is dead, because Absalom had reported so, since hee forced his sister Tamar.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Nowe therefore let not my lord the King take the thing so grieuously, to thinke that all ye Kings sonnes are dead: for Amnon only is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then Absalom fled: and the yong man that kept the watch, lift vp his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behinde him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Ionadab said vnto the King, Behold, ye Kings sonnes come: as thy seruant sayd, so it is.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And assoone as hee had left speaking, behold, the Kings sonnes came, and lift vp their voyces, and wept: and the King also and all his seruants wept exceedingly sore.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But Absalom fled away, and went to Talmai the sonne of Ammihur King of Geshur: and Dauid mourned for his sonne euery day.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three yeeres.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And King Dauid desired to go forth vnto Absalom, because he was pacified concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
