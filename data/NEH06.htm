And I answered them after the same maner.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then sent Sanballat his seruant after this sorte vnto me the fift time, with an open letter in his hand,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu hath sayd it, that thou and the Iewes thinke to rebel, for the which cause thou buildest the wall and thou wilt bee their King according to these wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thou hast also ordeyned the Prophets to preach of thee at Ierusalem, saying, There is a King in Iudah: and nowe according to these wordes it shall come to the Kings eares: come now therefore, and let vs take counsell together.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then I sent vnto him, saying, It is not done according to these wordes that thou sayest: for thou feynest them of thine owne heart.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For all they afrayed vs, saying, Their handes shalbe weakened from the worke, and it shall not be done: nowe therefore incourage thou me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I came to the house of Shemaiah the sonne of Delaiah the sonne of Mehetabeel, and he was shut vp, and he said, Let vs come together into the house of God in the middes of the Temple, and shut the doores of the Temple: for they will come to slay thee: yea, in the night will they come to kill thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then I said, Should such a man as I, flee? Who is he, being as I am, that would go into the Temple to liue? I will not goe in.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And loe, I perceiued, that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecie against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore was he hyred, that I might be afrayde, and doe thus, and sinne, and that they might haue an euill report that they might reproche me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>My God, remember thou Tobiah, and Sanballat according vnto these their workes, and Noadiah the Prophetesse also, and the rest of the Prophets that would haue put me in feare.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Notwithstanding the wall was finished on the fiue and twentieth day of Elul, in two and fiftie dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when all our enemies heard thereof, euen all the heathen that were about vs, they were afraid, and their courage failed them: for they knew, that this worke was wrought by our God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And in these dayes were there many of the princes of Iudah, whose letters went vnto Tobiah, and those of Tobiah came vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For there were many in Iudah, that were sworne vnto him: for he was the sonne in lawe of Shechaniah, the sonne of Arah: and his sonne Iehonathan had the daughter of Meshullam, the sonne of Berechiah.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yea, they spake in his praise before me, and tolde him my wordes, and Tobiah sent letters to put me in feare. </div><ul class='tnav'>
