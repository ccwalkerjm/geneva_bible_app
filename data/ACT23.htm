 <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they that stood by, sayd, Reuilest thou Gods hie Priest?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then sayd Paul, I knewe not, brethren, that he was the hie Priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speake euill of the ruler of thy people.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But when Paul perceiued that the one part were of the Sadduces, and the other of the Pharises, hee cried in the Council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharise, the sonne of a Pharise: I am accused of the hope and resurrection of the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when hee had saide this, there was a dissension betweene the Pharises and the Sadduces, so that the multitude was deuided.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the Sadduces say that there is no resurrection, neither Angel, nor spirit: but the Pharises confesse both.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then there was a great crye: and the Scribes of the Pharises part rose vp, and stroue, saying, Wee finde none euill in this man: but if a spirit or an Angel hath spoken to him, let vs not fight against God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And when there was a great dissension, the chiefe captaine, fearing lest Paul should haue bene pulled in pieces of them, commanded the souldiers to go downe, and take him from among them, and to bring him into the castel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Nowe the night folowing, the Lord stoode by him, and saide, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified of mee in Hierusalem, so must thou beare witnesse also at Rome.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when the day was come, certaine of the Iewes made an assemblie, and bounde themselues with a curse, saying, that they woulde neither eate nor drinke, till they had killed Paul.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they were more then fourtie, which had made this conspiracie.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they came to the chiefe Priestes and Elders, and said, We haue bound our selues with a solemne curse, that wee will eate nothing, vntill we haue slaine Paul.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nowe therefore, ye and the Council signifie to the chiefe captaine, that hee bring him foorth vnto you to morow: as though you would know some thing more perfectly of him, and we, or euer he come neere, will be readie to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But when Pauls sisters sonne heard of their laying awaite, he went, and entred into the castel, and tolde Paul.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Paul called one of the Centurions vnto him, and said, Take this yong man hence vnto the chiefe captaine: for he hath a certaine thing to shewe him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So hee tooke him, and brought him to the chiefe captaine, and saide, Paul the prisoner called mee vnto him, and prayed mee to bring this yong man vnto thee, which hath some thing to say vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then the chiefe captaine tooke him by the hande, and went apart with him alone, and asked him, What hast thou to shewe me?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he saide, The Iewes haue conspired to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring foorth Paul to morow into the Council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But let them not perswade thee: for there lie in waite for him of them, more then fourtie men, which haue bound themselues with a curse, that they will neither eate nor drinke, till they haue killed him: and nowe are they readie, and waite for thy promise.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The chiefe captaine then let the yong man depart, after hee had charged him to vtter it to no man, that he had shewed him these things.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he called vnto him two certaine Centurions, saying, Make readie two hundred souldiers, that they may go to Cæsarea, and horsemen three score and ten, and two hundred with dartes, at the thirde houre of the night.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And let them make readie an horse, that Paul being set on, may be brought safe vnto Felix the Gouernour.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he wrote an epistle in this maner:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Claudius Lysias vnto the most noble Gouernour Felix sendeth greeting.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As this man was taken of the Iewes, and shoulde haue bene killed of them, I came vpon them with the garison, and rescued him, perceiuing that he was a Romane.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when I would haue knowen the cause, wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their Council.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There I perceiued that hee was accused of questions of their Lawe, but had no crime worthy of death, or of bondes.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when it was shewed me, how that the Iewes layd waite for the man, I sent him straightway to thee, and commanded his accusers to speake before thee the thinges that they had against him. Farewell.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then the souldiers as it was commanded them, tooke Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the next day, they left the horsemen to goe with him, and returned vnto the Castel.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Now when they came to Cæsarea, they deliuered the epistle to the Gouernour, and presented Paul also vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So when the Gouernour had read it, hee asked of what prouince he was: and when he vnderstoode that he was of Cilicia,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I will heare thee, said he, when thine accusers also are come, and commanded him to bee kept in Herods iudgement hall. </div><ul class='tnav'>
