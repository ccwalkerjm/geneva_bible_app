O Lord my God, in thee I put my trust: saue me from all that persecute me, and deliuer me,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Least he deuoure my soule like a lion, and teare it in pieces, while there is none to helpe.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>O Lord my God, if I haue done this thing, if there be any wickednes in mine handes,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If I haue rewarded euill vnto him that had peace with mee, (yea I haue deliuered him that vexed me without cause)  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then let the enemie persecute my soule and take it: yea, let him treade my life downe vpon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift vp thy selfe against the rage of mine enemies, and awake for mee according to the iudgement that thou hast appointed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So shall the Congregation of the people compasse thee about: for their sakes therefore returne on hie.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord shall iudge the people: Iudge thou me, O Lord, according to my righteousnesse, and according to mine innocencie, that is in mee.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Oh let the malice of the wicked come to an ende: but guide thou the iust: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reines.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My defence is in God, who preserueth the vpright in heart.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>God iudgeth the righteous, and him that contemneth God euery day.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Except he turne, he hath whet his sword: he hath bent his bowe and made it readie.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hee hath also prepared him deadly weapons: hee will ordeine his arrowes for them that persecute me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Beholde, hee shall trauaile with wickednes: for he hath conceiued mischiefe, but he shall bring foorth a lye.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hee hath made a pitte and digged it, and is fallen into the pit that he made.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>His mischiefe shall returne vpon his owne head, and his crueltie shall fall vpon his owne pate.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I wil praise the Lord according to his righteousnes, and will sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high. </div><ul class='tnav'>
