<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 30</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel, and Iudah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Ierusalem, to keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the King and his princes and all the Congregation had taken counsel in Ierusalem to keepe the Passeouer in the second moneth.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For they could not keepe it at this time, because there were not Priests enow sanctified, neither was the people gathered to Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the thing pleased the King, and all the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they decreed to make proclamation throughout all Israel from Beersheba euen to Dan, that they should come to keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord God of Israel at Ierusalem: for they had not done it of a great time, as it was written.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So the postes went with letters by the commission of the King, and his princes, thorowout all Israel and Iudah, and with the commandement of the King, saying, Ye children of Israel, turne againe vnto the Lord God of Abraham, Izhak, and Israel, and he will returne to the remnant that are escaped of you, out of ye hands of the Kings of Asshur.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers: and therfore he made them desolate, as ye see.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Be not ye now stiffenecked like your fathers, but giue the hand to the Lord, and come into his sanctuarie, which he hath sanctified for euer, and serue the Lord your God, and the fiercenesse of his wrath shall turne away from you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For if ye returne vnto the Lord, your brethren and your children shall finde mercy before them that led them captiues, and they shall returne vnto this lande: for the Lord your God is gracious and mercifull, and will not turne away his face from you, if ye conuert vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So the postes went from citie to citie thorow the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, euen vnto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorne, and mocked them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse diuers of Asher, and Manasseh, and of Zebulun submitted themselues, and came to Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the hand of God was in Iudah, so that he gaue them one heart to doe the commandement of the King, and of the rulers, according to the worde of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And there assembled to Ierusalem much people, to keepe the feast of ye vnleauened bread in the second moneth, a very great assemblie.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they arose, and tooke away the altars that were in Ierusalem: and all those for incense tooke they away, and cast them into the brooke Kidron.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Afterwarde they slewe the Passeouer the fourteenth day of the seconde moneth: and the Priestes and Leuites were ashamed, and sanctified themselues, and brought the burnt offrings into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they stoode in their place after their maner, according to the Lawe of Moses the man of God: and the Priestes sprinkled the blood, receiued of the handes of the Leuites.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Because there were many in the Congregation that were not sanctified, therefore the Leuites had the charge of the killing of ye Passeouer for all that were not cleane, to sanctifie it to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For a multitude of the people, euen a multitude of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not cleansed themselues, yet did eate the Passeouer, but not as it was written: wherefore Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good Lord be mercifull toward him,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>That prepareth his whole heart to seeke the Lord God, the God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed, according to the purification of the Sanctuarie.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord heard Hezekiah, and healed the people.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the children of Israel that were present at Ierusalem, kept the feast of the vnleauened bread seuen dayes with great ioye, and the Leuites, and the Priestes praysed the Lord, day by day, singing with loude instruments vnto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Hezekiah spake comfortably vnto all the Leuites that had good knowledge to sing vnto the Lord: and they did eate in that feast seuen dayes, and offred peace offrings, and praysed the Lord God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the whole assembly tooke counsel to keepe it other seuen dayes. So they kept it seuen dayes with ioy.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For Hezekiah King of Iudah had giuen to the Congregation a thousande bullockes, and seuen thousand sheepe. And the princes had giuen to the Congregation a thousand bullocks, and ten thousand sheepe: and many Priests were sanctified.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And all the Congregation of Iudah reioyced with the Priestes and the Leuites, and all the Congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So there was great ioye in Ierusalem: for since the time of Salomon the sonne of Dauid King of Israel there was not the like thing in Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the Priests and the Leuites arose, and blessed the people, and their voyce was heard, and their prayer came vp vnto heauen, to his holy habitation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
