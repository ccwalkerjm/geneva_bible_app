So the maide went and called the childes mother,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>To whome Pharaohs daughter sayde, Take this childe away, and nurce it for me, and I wil reward thee. Then the woman tooke the childe and nurced him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Nowe the childe grewe, and she brought him vnto Pharaohs daughter, and he was as her sonne, and she called his name Moses, because, said she, I drewe him out of the water.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And in those dayes, when Moses was growen, he went forth vnto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: also he sawe an Egyptian smiting an Ebrewe one of his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he looked rounde about, and when he sawe no man, hee slewe the Egyptian, and hid him in the sande.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Againe he came forth the second day, and behold, two Ebrewes stroue: and he said vnto him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellowe?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And hee answered, Who made thee a man of authoritie, and a iudge ouer vs? Thinkest thou to kill mee, as thou killedst the Egyptian? Then Moses feared and sayde, Certainly this thing is knowen.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now Pharaoh heard this matter, and sought to slay Moses: therefore Moses fled from Pharaoh, and dwelt in the lande of Midian, and hee sate downe by a well.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Priest of Midian had seue daughters, which came and drewe water, and filled the troghes, for to water their fathers sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then the shepherds came and droue them away: but Moses rose vp and defended them, and watered their sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And whe they came to Reuel their father, he said, Howe are ye come so soone to day?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they saide, A man of Egypt deliuered vs from the hand of the shepherdes, and also drew vs water ynough, and watered the sheepe.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then he saide vnto his daughters, And where is he? why haue ye so left the man? call him that he may eate bread.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Moses agreed to dwell with the man: who gaue vnto Moses Zipporah his daughter:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And she bare a sonne, whose name he called Gershom: for he said, I haue bene a stranger in a strange lande.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then in processe of time, the King of Egypt dyed, and the children of Israel sighed for the bondage and cryed: and their crie for the bondage came vp vnto God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then God heard their mone, and God remembred his couenant with Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So God looked vpon the children of Israel, and God had respect vnto them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
