<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Nowe before the feast of the Passeouer, when Iesus knewe that his houre was come, that he should depart out of this world vnto the Father, forasmuch as he loued his owne which were in the world, vnto the end he loued them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And when supper was done (and that the deuill had now put in the heart of Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne, to betray him)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Iesus knowing that the Father had giuen all things into his hands, and that he was come forth from God, and went to God,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his vpper garments, and tooke a towel, and girded himselfe.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>After that, hee powred water into a basen, and began to wash the disciples feete, and to wipe them with the towell, wherewith he was girded.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then came he to Simon Peter, who sayd to him, Lord, doest thou wash my feete?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Iesus answered and sayd vnto him, What I doe, thou knowest not nowe: but thou shalt knowe it hereafter.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Peter said vnto him, Thou shalt neuer wash my feete. Iesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou shalt haue no part with me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Simon Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, not my feete onely, but also the hands and the head.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Iesus sayd to him, He that is washed, needeth not, saue to wash his feete, but is cleane euery whit: and ye are cleane, but not all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For hee knewe who should betray him: therefore sayd he, Ye are not all cleane.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So after he had washed their feete, and had taken his garments, and was set downe againe, he sayd vnto them, Knowe ye what I haue done to you?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Ye call me Master, and Lord, and ye say well: for so am I.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If I then your Lord, and Master, haue washed your feete, ye also ought to wash one an others feete.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I haue giuen you an example, that ye should doe, euen as I haue done to you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Verely, verely I say vnto you, The seruant is not greater then his master, neither the ambassadour greater then he that sent him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If ye know these things, blessed are ye, if ye doe them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I speake not of you all: I know whom I haue chosen: but it is that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift vp his heele against me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>From henceforth tell I you before it come, that when it is come to passe, ye might beleeue that I am he.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Verely, verely I say vnto you, If I send any, he that receiueth him, receiueth me, and hee that receiueth me, receiueth him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When Iesus had sayd these things, he was troubled in the Spirit, and testified, and said, Verely, verely I say vnto you, that one of you shall betray me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nowe there was one of his disciples, which leaned on Iesus bosome, whom Iesus loued.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>To him beckened therefore Simon Peter, that he should aske who it was of whom he spake.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He then, as he leaned on Iesus breast, saide vnto him, Lord, who is it?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Iesus answered, He it is, to whome I shall giue a soppe, when I haue dipt it: and hee wet a soppe, and gaue it to Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And after the soppe, Satan entred into him. Then sayd Iesus vnto him, That thou doest, doe quickly.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But none of them that were at table, knew, for what cause he spake it vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For some of them thought because Iudas had the bag, that Iesus had sayd vnto him, Buy those things that we haue neede of against ye feast: or that he should giue some thing to the poore.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Assoone then as he had receiued the soppe, he went immediately out, and it was night.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>When hee was gone out, Iesus sayd, Nowe is the Sonne of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorifie him in himselfe, and shall straightway glorifie him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Litle children, yet a litle while am I with you: ye shall seeke me, but as I sayde vnto the Iewes, Whither I goe, can ye not come: also to you say I nowe,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>A newe commandement giue I vnto you, that ye loue one another: as I haue loued you, that ye also loue one another.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>By this shall all men knowe that ye are my disciples, if ye haue loue one to another.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Simon Peter said vnto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Iesus answered him, Whither I goe, thou canst not follow me nowe: but thou shalt follow me afterward.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay downe my life for thy sake.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Iesus answered him, Wilt thou lay downe thy life for my sake? Verely, verely I say vnto thee, The cocke shall not crowe, till thou haue denied me thrise. </div><ul class='tnav'>
