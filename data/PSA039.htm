I thought, I will take heede to my wayes, that I sinne not with my tongue: I will keepe my mouth brideled, while the wicked is in my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I was dumme and spake nothing: I kept silece euen from good, and my sorow was more stirred.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Mine heart was hote within me, and while I was musing, the fire kindeled, and I spake with my tongue, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Lord, let me know mine ende, and the measure of my dayes, what it is: let mee knowe howe long I haue to liue.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Beholde, thou hast made my dayes as an hand breadth, and mine age as nothing in respect of thee: surely euery man in his best state is altogether vanitie. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Doubtlesse man walketh in a shadowe, and disquieteth himselfe in vaine: he heapeth vp riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And now Lord, what wait I for? mine hope is euen in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Deliuer me from all my transgressions, and make me not a rebuke vnto the foolish.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I should haue bene dumme, and not haue opened my mouth, because thou didest it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Take thy plague away from mee: for I am consumed by the stroke of thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When thou with rebukes doest chastise man for iniquitie, thou as a mothe makest his beautie to consume: surely euery man is vanitie. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Heare my prayer, O Lord, and hearken vnto my cry: keepe not silence at my teares, for I am a strager with thee, and a soiourner as all my fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Stay thine anger from me, that I may recouer my strength, before I go hence and be not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
