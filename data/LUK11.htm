Therefore shall they be your iudges.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if I by ye finger of God cast out deuils, doutles the kingdome of God is come vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, the thinges that hee possesseth, are in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But when a stronger then hee, commeth vpon him, and ouercommeth him: hee taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and deuideth his spoiles.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When the vncleane spirite is gone out of a man, he walketh through drie places, seeking rest: and when he findeth none he saieth, I wil returne vnto mine house whence I came out.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then goeth hee, and taketh to him seuen other spirites worse then himselfe: and they enter in, and dwel there: so the last state of that man is worse then the first.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to passe as he sayde these thinges, a certaine woman of the companie lifted vp her voyce, and sayde vnto him, Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes which thou hast sucked.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But hee saide, Yea, rather blessed are they that heare the woorde of God, and keepe it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when the people were gathered thicke together, he began to say, This is a wicked generation: they seeke a signe, and there shall no signe be giuen them, but the signe of Ionas the Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For as Ionas was a signe to the Niniuites: so shall also the Sonne of man bee to this generation.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Queene of the South shall rise in iudgement, with the men of this generation, and shall condemne them: for shee came from the vtmost partes of the earth to heare the wisedome of Salomon, and beholde, a greater then Salomon is here.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The men of Niniue shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for they repented at the preaching of Ionas: and beholde, a greater then Ionas is here.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>No man when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a priuie place, neither vnder a bushell: but on a candlesticke, that they which come in, may see the light.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The light of the bodie is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, then is thy whole bodie light: but if thine eye be euill, then thy bodie is darke.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Take heede therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darkenesse.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>If therefore thy whole body shall be light, hauing no part darke, then shall all be light, euen as when a candle doth light thee with the brightnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And as hee spake, a certaine Pharise besought him to dine with him: and hee went in, and sate downe at table.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And when the Pharise saw it, he marueiled that he had not first washed before dinner.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the Lord saide to him, In deede yee Pharises make cleane the outside of the cuppe, and of the platter: but the inwarde part is full of rauening and wickednesse.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Ye fooles, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is within also?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Therefore, giue almes of those thinges which you haue, and beholde, all thinges shall be cleane to you.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But wo be to you, Pharises: for ye tithe the mynt and the rewe, and all maner herbs, and passe ouer iudgement and the loue of God: these ought yee to haue done, and not to haue left the other vndone.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Wo be to you, Pharises: for ye loue the vppermost seats in the Synagogues, and greetings in the markets.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye are as graues which appeare not, and the men that walke ouer them, perceiue not.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then answered one of the Lawyers, and saide vnto him, Master, thus saying thou puttest vs to rebuke also.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he sayde, Wo be to you also, yee Lawyers: for yee lade men with burdens grieuous to be borne, and yee your selues touche not the burdens with one of your fingers.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Wo be to you: for ye builde the sepulchres of the Prophetes, and your fathers killed them.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Truely ye beare witnesse, and allowe the deedes of your fathers: for they killed them, and yee build their sepulchres.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Therefore said the wisedome of God, I wil sende them Prophets and Apostles, and of them they shall slaie, and persecute away,  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>That the blood of all the Prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation,  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>From the blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias, which was slaine betweene the altar and the Temple: verely I say vnto you, it shall be required of this generation.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Wo be to you, Lawyers: for ye haue taken away the key of knowledge: ye entred not in your selues, and them that came in, ye forbade.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And as he sayde these things vnto them, the Scribes and Pharises began to vrge him sore, and to prouoke him to speake of many things,  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Laying wait for him, and seeking to catche some thing of his mouth, whereby they might accuse him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
