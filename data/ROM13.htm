Wilt thou then bee without feare of the power? doe well: so shalt thou haue praise of the same.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For he is ye minister of God for thy wealth, but if thou do euill, feare: for he beareth not the sworde for nought: for he is the minister of God to take vengeance on him that doeth euill.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Wherefore ye must bee subiect, not because of wrath only, but also for conscience sake.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For, for this cause ye pay also tribute: for they are Gods ministers, applying themselues for the same thing.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Giue to all men therefore their duetie: tribute, to whome yee owe tribute: custome, to whom custome: feare, to whome feare: honour, to whom ye owe honour.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Owe nothing to any man, but to loue one another: for he that loueth another, hath fulfilled the Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For this, Thou shalt not commit adulterie, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steale, Thou shalt not beare false witnes, Thou shalt not couet: and if there be any other commandement, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, euen in this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Loue doeth not euill to his neighbour: therefore is loue the fulfilling of the Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And that, considering the season, that it is now time that we should arise from sleepe: for now is our saluation neerer, then when we beleeued it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The night is past, and the day is at hande, let vs therefore cast away the workes of darkenesse, and let vs put on the armour of light,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So that wee walke honestly, as in the day: not in gluttonie, and drunkennesse, neither in chambering and wantonnes, nor in strife and enuying.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But put yee on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and take no thought for the flesh, to fulfill the lustes of it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
