Ishmael dwelt in the presence of all his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Likewise these are the generations of Izhak Abrahams sonne Abraham begate Izhak,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Izhak was fourtie yeere olde, when he tooke Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramite of Padan Aram, and sister to Laban the Aramite.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Izhak prayed vuto the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceiued,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the children stroue together within her: therefore shee sayde, Seeing it is so, why am I thus? wherefore she went to aske the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord sayd to her, Two nations are in thy wombe, and two maner of people shalbe diuided out of thy bowels, and the one people shall be mightier then the other, and the elder shall serue the yonger.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore when her time of deliuerance was fulfilled, behold, twinnes were in her wombe.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So he that came out first was red, and he was all ouer as a rough garment, and they called his name Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And afterward came his brother out, and his hande helde Esau by the heele: therefore his name was called Iaakob. Nowe Izhak was threescore yeere olde when Rebekah bare them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the boyes grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, and liued in the fields: but Iaakob was a plaine man, and dwelt in tentes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Izhak loued Esau, for venison was his meate, but Rebekah loued Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Nowe Iaakob sod pottage, and Esau came from the fielde and was wearie.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Esau sayd to Iaakob, Let me eate, I pray thee, of that pottage so red, for I am wearie. Therefore was his name called Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Iaakob sayd, Sell me euen nowe thy birthright.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Esau sayd, Lo, I am almost dead, what is then this birthright to me?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Iaakob then said, Sweare to me euen now. And he sware to him, and solde his birthright vnto Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then Iaakob gaue Esau bread and pottage of lentiles: and he did eate and drinke, and rose vp, and went his way: So Esau contemned his birthright. </div><ul class='tnav'>
