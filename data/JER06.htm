Your burnt offerings are not pleasant, nor your sacrifices sweete vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore thus sayeth the Lord, Beholde, I will laie stumbling blockes before this people, and the fathers and the sonnes together shall fall vpon them: the neighbour and his friende shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord, Beholde, a people commeth from the North countrey, and a great nation shall arise from the sides of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>With bowe and shield shall they be weaponed: they are cruell and will haue no compassion: their voyce roareth like the sea, and they ride vpon horses, well appointed, like men of warre against thee, O daughter Zion.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>We haue heard their fame, and our handes waxe feeble sorrowe is come vpon vs, as the sorrowe of a woman in trauaile.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Goe not foorth into the fielde, nor walke by the way: for the sword of the enemie and feare is on euery side.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>O daughter of my people, girde thee with sackecloth, and wallowe thy selfe in the ashes: make lamentation, and bitter mourning as for thine onely sonne: for the destroier shall suddenly come vpon vs.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I haue set thee for a defence and fortresse among my people, that thou maiest knowe and trie their waies.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They are all rebellious traitours, walking craftily: they are brasse, and yron, they all are destroyers.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The bellowes are burnt: the lead is consumed in the fire: the founder melteth in vaine: for the wicked are not taken away.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They shall call them reprobate siluer, because the Lord hath reiected them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
