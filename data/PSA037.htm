<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 37</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>A Psalme of David. Fret not thy selfe because of the wicked men, neither be enuious for the euill doers.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For they shall soone bee cut downe like grasse, and shall wither as the greene herbe.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Trust thou in the Lord and do good: dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed assuredly.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And delite thy selfe in the Lord, and hee shall giue thee thine hearts desire.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Commit thy way vnto the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall bring it to passe.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he shall bring foorth thy righteousnes as the light, and thy iudgement as the noone day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Waite patiently vpon the Lord and hope in him: fret not thy selfe for him which prospereth in his way: nor for the man that bringeth his enterprises to passe.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Cease from anger, and leaue off wrath: fret not thy selfe also to doe euill.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For euill doers shalbe cut off, and they that wait vpon the Lord, they shall inherite the land.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore yet a litle while, and the wicked shall not appeare, and thou shalt looke after his place, and he shall not be found.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But meeke men shall possesse the earth, and shall haue their delite in the multitude of peace.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The wicked practiseth against the iust, and gnasheth his teeth against him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the Lord shall laugh him to scorne: for he seeth, that his day is comming.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The wicked haue drawen their sworde, and haue bent their bowe, to cast downe the poore and needie, and to slay such as be of vpright conuersation.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But their sword shall enter into their owne heart, and their bowes shalbe broken.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A small thing vnto the iust man is better, then great riches to the wicked and mightie.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the armes of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord vpholdeth the iust men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Lord knoweth the dayes of vpright men, and their inheritance shall bee perpetuall.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They shall not be confounded in the perilous time, and in the daies of famine they shall haue ynough.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be consumed as the fatte of lambes: euen with the smoke shall they consume away.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The wicked boroweth and payeth not againe. but the righteous is mercifull, and giueth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For such as be blessed of God, shall inherite the lande, and they that be cursed of him, shalbe cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The pathes of man are directed by the Lord: for he loueth his way.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Though he fall, hee shall not be cast off: for the Lord putteth vnder his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I haue beene yong, and am olde: yet I sawe neuer the righteous forsaken, nor his seede begging bread.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But hee is euer mercifull and lendeth, and his seede enioyeth the blessing.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Flee from euill and doe good, and dwell for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For the Lord loueth iudgement, and forsaketh not his Saintes: they shall be preserued for euermore: but the seede of the wicked shall be cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The righteous men shall inherit the lande, and dwell therein for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The mouth of the righteous will speake of wisedome, and his tongue will talke of iudgement.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For the Lawe of his God is in his heart, and his steppes shall not slide.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But the Lord wil not leaue him in his hand, nor condemne him, when he is iudged.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Waite thou on the Lord, and keepe his way, and he shall exalt thee, that thou shalt inherite the lande: when the wicked men shall perish, thou shalt see.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I haue seene the wicked strong, and spreading himselfe like a greene bay tree.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Yet he passed away, and loe, he was gone, and I sought him, but he could not be founde.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Marke the vpright man, and beholde the iust: for the end of that man is peace.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But the transgressours shall be destroyed together, and the ende of the wicked shall bee cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But the saluation of the righteous men shalbe of the Lord: he shalbe their strength in the time of trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For the Lord shall helpe them, and deliuer them: he shall deliuer them from the wicked, and shall saue them, because they trust in him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
