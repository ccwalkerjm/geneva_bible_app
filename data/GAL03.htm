Hee saith not, And to the seedes, as speaking of many: but, And to thy seede, as of one, which is Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And this I say, that the couenant that was confirmed afore of God in respect of Christ, the Lawe which was foure hundreth and thirtie yeeres after, can not disanull, that it shoulde make the promise of none effect.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For if the inheritance be of the Lawe, it is no more by the promise, but God gaue it freely vnto Abraham by promise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Wherefore then serueth the Law? It was added because of the transgressions, til the seed came, vnto the which the promise was made: and it was ordeined by Angels in the hande of a Mediatour.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Nowe a Mediatour is not a Mediatour of one: but God is one.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Is the Lawe then against the promises of God? God forbid: For if there had bene a Lawe giuen which coulde haue giuen life, surely righteousnes should haue bene by the Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the promise by the faith of Iesus Christ should be giuen to them that beleeue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But before faith came, we were kept vnder the Law, as vnder a garison, and shut vp vnto that faith, which should afterward be reueiled.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Wherefore the Lawe was our scholemaster to bring vs to Christ, that we might be made righteous by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But after that faith is come, we are no longer vnder a scholemaster.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For ye are al the sonnes of God by faith, in Christ Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For all ye that are baptized into Christ, haue put on Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>There is neither Iewe nor Grecian: there is neither bonde nor free: there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And if ye be Christes, then are ye Abrahams seede, and heires by promise. </div><ul class='tnav'>
