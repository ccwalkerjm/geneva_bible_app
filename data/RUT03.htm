And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmayd: spread therefore the wing of thy garment ouer thine handmayd: for thou art the kinsman.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then sayd he, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: thou hast shewed more goodnes in the latter end, then at the beginning, in as much as thou followedst not yong men, were they poore or rich.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now, my daughter, feare not: I will doe to thee all that thou requirest: for all the citie of my people doeth knowe, that thou art a vertuous woman.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And now, it is true that I am thy kinsman, howbeit there is a kinsman neerer then I.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Tarie to night, and when morning is come, if he will doe the duetie of a kinsman vnto thee, well, let him doe the kinsmans duetie: but if he will not doe the kinsmans part, then wil I doe the duetie of a kinsman, as the Lord liueth: sleepe vntill the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And she lay at his feete vntill the morning: and she arose before one could know another: for he sayd, Let no man knowe, that a woman came into the floore.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Also he sayd, Bring the sheete that thou hast vpon thee, and holde it. And when she helde it, he measured sixe measures of barly, and layde them on her, and she went into the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when she came to her mother in law, she sayd, Who art thou, my daughter? And she tolde her all that the man had done to her,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And said, These sixe measures of barly gaue he me: for he sayd to me, Thou shalt not come emptie vnto thy mother in lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then sayd she, My daughter, sit still, vntill thou knowe how the thing will fall: for the man wil not be in rest, vntill he hath finished the matter this same day. </div><ul class='tnav'>
