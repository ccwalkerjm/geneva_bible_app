And I tooke the thirtie pieces of siluer, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then brake I mine other staffe, euen the Bandes, that I might dissolue the brotherhood betweene Iudah and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord said vnto me, Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepheard.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For loe, I will rayse vp a shepheard in the land, which shall not looke for the thing, that is lost, nor seeke the tender lambes, nor heale that that is hurt, nor feede that that standeth vp: but he shall eate the flesh of the fat, and teare their clawes in pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>O idole shepheard that leaueth the flocke: the sword shalbe vpon his arme, and vpon his right eye. His arme shall be cleane dryed vp, and his right eye shall be vtterly darkened. </div><ul class='tnav'>
