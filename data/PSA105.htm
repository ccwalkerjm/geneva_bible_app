<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 105</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Praise the Lord, and call vpon his Name: declare his workes among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Sing vnto him, sing prayse vnto him, and talke of all his wonderous workes.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Reioyce in his holy Name: let the heart of them that seeke the Lord, reioyce.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Seeke the Lord and his strength: seeke his face continually.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Remember his marueilous woorkes, that he hath done, his wonders and the iudgements of his mouth,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Ye seede of Abraham his seruant, ye children of Iaakob, which are his elect.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He is the Lord our God: his iudgements are through all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He hath alway remembred his couenant and promise, that he made to a thousand generations,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Euen that which he made with Abraham, and his othe vnto Izhak:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And since hath confirmed it to Iaakob for a lawe, and to Israel for an euerlasting couenant,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Saying, Vnto thee will I giue the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Albeit they were fewe in nomber, yea, very fewe, and strangers in the land,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And walked about from nation to nation, from one kingdome to another people,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Yet suffered he no man to doe them wrong, but reprooued Kings for their sakes, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Touche not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harme.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Moreouer, he called a famine vpon ye land, and vtterly brake the staffe of bread.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But he sent a man before them: Ioseph was solde for a slaue.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They helde his feete in the stockes, and he was laide in yrons,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Vntill his appointed time came, and the counsell of the Lord had tryed him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The King sent and loosed him: euen the Ruler of the people deliuered him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>That he shoulde binde his princes vnto his will, and teach his Ancients wisedome.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Israel came to Egypt, and Iaakob was a stranger in the land of Ham.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he increased his people exceedingly, and made them stronger then their oppressours.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He turned their heart to hate his people, and to deale craftily with his seruants.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then sent he Moses his seruant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They shewed among them the message of his signes, and wonders in the land of Ham.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He sent darkenesse, and made it darke: and they were not disobedient vnto his commission.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He turned their waters into blood, and slewe their fish.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Their land brought foorth frogs, euen in their Kings chambers.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He spake, and there came swarmes of flies and lice in all their quarters.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He gaue them haile for raine, and flames of fire in their land.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He smote their vines also and their figge trees, and brake downe the trees in their coastes.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He spake, and the grashoppers came, and caterpillers innumerable,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And did eate vp all the grasse in their land, and deuoured the fruite of their ground.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He smote also all the first borne in their land, euen the beginning of all their strength.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He brought them forth also with siluer and golde, and there was none feeble among their tribes.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Egypt was glad at their departing: for the feare of them had fallen vpon them.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>He spred a cloude to be a couering, and fire to giue light in the night.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>They asked, and he brought quailes, and he filled them with the bread of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>He opened the rocke, and the waters flowed out, and ranne in the drye places like a riuer.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>For he remembred his holy promise to Abraham his seruant,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he brought forth his people with ioy, and his chosen with gladnesse,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And gaue them the lands of the heathen, and they tooke the labours of the people in possession,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>That they might keepe his statutes, and obserue his Lawes. Prayse ye the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
