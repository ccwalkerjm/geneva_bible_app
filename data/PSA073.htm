Yet God is good to Israel: euen, to the pure in heart.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>As for me, my feete were almost gone: my steps had well neere slipt.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For I feared at the foolish, when I sawe the prosperitie of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For there are no bandes in their death, but they are lustie and strong.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued with other men.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore pride is as a chayne vnto them, and crueltie couereth them as a garment.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Their eyes stande out for fatnesse: they haue more then heart can wish.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They are licentious, and speake wickedly of their oppression: they talke presumptuously.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They set their mouth against heauen, and their tongue walketh through the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore his people turne hither: for waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they say, Howe doeth God know it? or is there knowledge in the most High?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Lo, these are the wicked, yet prosper they alway, and increase in riches.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Certainely I haue clensed mine heart in vaine, and washed mine hands in innocencie.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For dayly haue I bene punished, and chastened euery morning.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If I say, I will iudge thus, beholde the generation of thy children: I haue trespassed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then thought I to know this, but it was too painefull for me,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Vntill I went into the Sanctuarie of God: then vnderstoode I their ende.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Surely thou hast set them in slipperie places, and castest them downe into desolation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>How suddenly are they destroyed, perished and horribly consumed,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As a dreame when one awaketh! O Lord, when thou raisest vs vp, thou shalt make their image despised.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Certainely mine heart was vexed, and I was pricked in my reines:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So foolish was I and ignorant: I was a beast before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet I was alway with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thou wilt guide me by thy counsell, and afterward receiue me to glory.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whom haue I in heauen but thee? and I haue desired none in the earth with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>My flesh fayleth and mine heart also: but God is the strength of mine heart, and my portion for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For loe, they that withdrawe themselues from thee, shall perish: thou destroyest all them that goe a whoring from thee.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As for me, it is good for me to draw neere to God: therefore I haue put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy workes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
