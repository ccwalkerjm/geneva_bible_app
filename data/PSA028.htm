Unto thee, O Lord, doe I crie: O my strength, be not deafe toward mee, lest, if thou answere me not, I be like them that goe downe into the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Heare the voyce of my petitions, when I crie vnto thee, when I holde vp mine handes towarde thine holy Oracle.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Drawe mee not away with the wicked, and with the woorkers of iniquitie: which speake friendly to their neighbours, when malice is in their hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Reward them according to their deedes, and according to the wickednes of their inuentions: recompense them after the woorke of their handes: render them their reward.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For they regarde not the woorkes of the Lord, nor the operation of his handes: therefore breake them downe, and builde them not vp.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Praised be the Lord, for he hath heard the voyce of my petitions.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lord is my strength and my shielde: mine heart trusted in him, and I was helped: therfore mine heart shall reioyce, and with my song will I praise him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord is their strength, and he is the strength of the deliuerances of his anointed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Saue thy people, and blesse thine inheritance: feede them also, and exalt them for euer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
