<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And as he behelde, he sawe the rich men, which cast their giftes into the treasurie.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he sawe also a certaine poore widowe which cast in thither two mites:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he sayd, Of a trueth I say vnto you, that this poore widowe hath cast in more then they all.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For they all haue of their superfluitie cast into the offerings of God: but she of her penurie hath cast in all the liuing that she had.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Nowe as some spake of the Temple, how it was garnished with goodly stones, and with consecrate things, he sayd,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Are these ye things that ye looke vpon? the dayes will come wherein a stone shall not be left vpon a stone, that shall not be throwen downe.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what signe shall there be when these things shall come to passe?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he sayd, Take heede, that ye be not deceiued: for many will come in my Name, saying, I am Christ, and the time draweth neere: follow ye not them therefore.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when ye heare of warres and seditions, be not afraid: for these things must first come, but the ende foloweth not by and by.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then said hee vnto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And great earthquakes shall be in diuers places, and hunger, and pestilence, and fearefull things, and great signes shall there be from heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, deliuering you vp to the assemblies, and into prisons, and bring you before Kings and rulers for my Names sake.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And this shall turne to you, for a testimoniall.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Lay it vp therefore in your heartes, that ye cast not before hand, what ye shall answere.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I will giue you a mouth and wisdome, where against all your aduersaries shall not be able to speake, nor resist.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Yea, ye shalbe betrayed also of your parents, and of your brethren, and kinsmen, and friendes, and some of you shall they put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And ye shall bee hated of all men for my Names sake.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Yet there shall not one heare of your heads perish.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>By your patience possesse your soules.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when ye see Hierusalem besieged with souldiers, then vnderstand that the desolation thereof is neere.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then let them which are in Iudea, flee to the mountaines: and let them which are in the middes thereof, depart out: and let not them that are in the countrey, enter therein.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For these be the dayes of vengeance, to fulfill all things that are written.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But woe be to them that be with childe, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes: for there shalbe great distresse in this land, and wrath ouer this people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they shall fall on the edge of the sword, and shalbe led captiue into all nations, and Hierusalem shalbe troden vnder foote of the Gentiles, vntill the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then there shalbe signes in the sunne, and in the moone, and in the starres, and vpon the earth trouble among the nations with perplexitie: the sea and the waters shall roare.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And mens hearts shall faile them for feare, and for looking after those thinges which shall come on the worlde: for the powers of heauen shall be shaken.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And then shall they see the Sonne of man come in a cloude, with power and great glory.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when these things beginne to come to passe, then looke vp, and lift vp your heades: for your redemption draweth neere.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he spake to them a parable, Behold, the figge tree, and all trees,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When they nowe shoote foorth, ye seeing them, knowe of your owne selues, that sommer is then neere.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So likewise yee, when yee see these thinges come to passe, knowe ye that the kingdome of God is neere.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto you, This age shall not passe, till all these things be done:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my wordes shall not passe away.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Take heede to your selues, lest at any time your hearts be oppressed with surfeting and drunkennesse, and cares of this life, and least that day come on you at vnwares.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Watche therefore, and pray continually, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these thinges that shall come to passe, and that ye may stand before the Sonne of man.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Nowe in the day time hee taught in the Temple, and at night hee went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Oliues.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And all the people came in the morning to him, to heare him in the Temple.
