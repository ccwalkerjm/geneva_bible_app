If I say vnto the boy, See, the arrowes are on this side thee, bring them, and come thou: for it is well with thee and no hurt, as the Lord liueth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But if I say thus vnto the boy, Behold, the arrowes are beyonde thee, goe thy way: for the Lord hath sent thee away.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>As touching the thing which thou and I haue spoken of, beholde, the Lord be betweene thee and me for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Dauid hid him selfe in the field: and when the first day of the moneth came, the King sate to eate meate.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the King sate, as at other times vpon his seate, euen vpon his seate by the wall: and Ionathan arose, and Abner sate by Sauls side, but Dauids place was emptie.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Saul sayde nothing that day: for hee thought, Some thing hath befallen him, though he were cleane, or els becaus he was not purified.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But on the morowe which was the second day of the moneth, Dauids place was emptie againe: and Saul sayde vnto Ionathan his sonne, Wherefore commeth not the sonne of Ishai to meate, neither yesterday nor to day?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Ionathan answered vnto Saul, Dauid required of me, that he might goe to Beth-lehem.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For he sayde, Let me goe, I pray thee: for our familie offreth a sacrifice in the citie, and my brother hath sent for me: therfore now if I haue found fauour in thine eyes, let me goe, I pray thee, and see my brethren: this is the cause that he commeth not vnto the Kings table.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then was Saul angrie with Ionathan, and sayde vnto him, Thou sonne of the wicked rebellious woman, doe not I know, that thou hast chosen the sonne of Ishai to thy confusion, and to the confusion and shame of thy mother?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For as long as the sonne of Ishai liueth vpon the earth, thou shalt not be stablished, nor thy kingdome: wherefore now send and fet him vnto me, for he shall surely die.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Ionathan answered vnto Saul his father, and said vnto him, Wherefore shall he die? what hath he done?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Saul cast a speare at him to hit him, whereby Ionathan knew, that it was determined of his father to slay Dauid.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So Ionathan arose from the table in a great anger, and did eate no meate the seconde day of the moneth: for he was sorie for Dauid, and because his father had reuiled him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>On the next morning therefore Ionathan than went out into the fielde, at the time appoynted with Dauid, and a litle boy with him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he saide vnto his boy, Runne now, seeke the arrowes which I shoote, and as the boy ran, he shot an arrowe beyond him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And when the boy was come to the place where the arrowe was that Ionathan had shot, Ionathan cryed after the boy, and sayde, Is not the arrowe beyond thee?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Ionathan cryed after the boy, Make speede, haste and stand not still: and Ionathans boy gathered vp the arrowes, and came to his master,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But the boy knewe nothing: onely Ionathan and Dauid knew the matter.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then Ionathan gaue his bowe and arrowes vnto the boy that was with him, and sayd vnto him, Goe, carrie them into the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Assoone as the boy was gone, Dauid arose out of a place that was towarde the South, and fel on his face to the ground, and bowed him selfe three times: and they kissed one another, and wept both twaine, till Dauid exceeded.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Therefore Ionathan said to Dauid, Goe in peace: that which we haue sworne both of vs in the Name of the Lord, saying, The Lord be betweene me and thee, and betweene my seede and betweene thy seede, let it stand for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he arose and departed, and Ionathan went into the citie. </div><ul class='tnav'>
