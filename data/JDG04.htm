And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went vp on his feete with ten thousand men, and Deborah went vp with him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>(Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in lawe of Moses, was departed from the Kenites, and pitched his tent vntill the playne of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh)  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then they shewed Sisera, that Barak the sonne of Abinoam was gone vp to mout Tabor.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Sisera called for all his charets, euen nine hundreth charets of yron, and all the people that were with him from Harosheth of the Gentiles, vnto the riuer Kishon.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Deborah sayd vnto Barak, Vp: for this is the day that the Lord hath deliuered Sisera into thine hand. Is not the Lord gone out before thee? So Barak went downe from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord destroyed Sisera and all his charets, and al his hoste with the edge of the sword before Barak, so that Sisera lighted downe off his charet, and fled away on his feete.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Barak pursued after the charets, and after the hoste vnto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the hoste of Sisera fel vpon the edge of the sworde: there was not a man left.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feete to the tent of Iael the wife of Heber the Kenite: (for peace was betweene Iabin the king of Hazor, and betweene the house of Heber the Kenite)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Iael went out to meete Sisera, and sayd vnto him, Turne in, my lord, turne in to me: feare not. And when he had turned in vnto her into her tent, she couered him with a mantell.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he said vnto her, Giue me, I pray thee, a litle water to drinke: for I am thirstie. And shee opened a bottel of milke, and gaue him drinke, and couered him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Againe he sayde vnto her, Stande in the doore of the tent, and when any man doth come and enquire of thee, saying, Is any man there? thou shalt say, Nay.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Iael Hebers wife tooke a nayle of the tent, and tooke an hammer in her hande, and went softly vnto him, and smote the nayle into his temples, and fastened it into the grounde, (for he was fast a sleepe and weary) and so he dyed.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And behold, as Barak pursued after Sisera, Iael came out to meete him, and sayd vnto him, Come, and I wil shewe thee the man, whome thou seekest: and when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nayle in his temples.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So God brought downe Iabin the King of Canaan that day before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the hande of the children of Israel prospered, and preuailed against Iabin the King of Canaan, vntill they had destroyed Iabin King of Canaan. </div><ul class='tnav'>
