And why, sayth the Lord of hostes? Because of mine House that is waste, and ye runne euery man vnto his owne house.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore the heauen ouer you stayed it selfe from dewe, and the earth stayed her fruite.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I called for a drought vpon the land, and vpon the mountaines, and vpon the corne, and vpon the wine, and vpon the oyle, vpon all that the ground bringeth foorth: both vpon men and vpon cattell, and vpon all the labour of the hands.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel, and Iehoshua the sonne of Iehozadak the hie Priest with all the remnant of the people, heard the voyce of the Lord their God, and the wordes of the Prophet Haggai (as the Lord their God had sent him) then the people did feare before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then spake Haggai the Lords messenger in the Lords message vnto the people, saying, I am with you, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord stirred vp the spirite of Zerubbabel, the sonne of Shealtiel a prince of Iudah, and the spirit of Iehoshua the sonne of Iehozadak the hie Priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, and they came, and did the worke in the House of the Lord of hostes their God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
