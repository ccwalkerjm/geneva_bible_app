<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Moreover he saide vnto me, Sonne of man, eate that thou findest: eate this roule, and goe, and speake vnto the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So I opened my mouth, and he gaue mee this roule to eate.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, cause thy belly to eate, and fill thy bowels with this roule that I giue thee. Then did I eate it, and it was in my mouth as sweete as honie.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, goe, and enter into the house of Israel, and declare them my wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For thou art not sent to a people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an hard language, but to the house of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Not to many people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an harde language, whose wordes thou canst not vnderstand: yet if I should sende thee to them, they would obey thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the house of Israel will not obey thee: for they will not obey me: yea, all the house of Israel are impudent and stiffe hearted.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Beholde, I haue made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead harde against their foreheads.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I haue made thy forehead as the adamant, and harder then the flint: feare them not therefore, neither be afraid at their lookes: for they are a rebellious house.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He said moreouer vnto me, Sonne of man, receiue in thine heart al my words that I speake vnto thee, and heare them with thine eares,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And goe and enter to them that are led away captiues vnto the children of thy people, and speake vnto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord God: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the spirite tooke me vp, and I heard behinde me a noise of a great russhing, saying, Blessed be ye glorie of the Lord out of his place.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I heard also the noyse of the wings of the beasts, that touched one another, and the ratling of the wheeles that were by them, euen a noyse of a great russhing.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the spirit lift me vp, and tooke me away and I went in bitternesse, and indignation of my spirite, but the hand of the Lord was strong vpon me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then I came to them that were led away captiues to Tel-abib, that dwelt by the riuer Chebar, and I sate where they sate, and remained there astonished among them seuen dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And at the ende of seuen dayes, the worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Sonne of man, I haue made thee a watchman vnto the house of Israel: therefore heare the worde at my mouth, and giue them warning from me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When I shall say vnto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die, and thou giuest not him warning, nor speakest to admonish the wicked of his wicked way, that he may liue, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquitie: but his blood will I require at thine hande.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wickednesse, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquitie, but thou hast deliuered thy soule.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Likewise if a righteous man turne from his righteousnesse, and commit iniquitie, I will lay a stumbling blocke before him, and he shall die, because thou hast not giuen him warning: he shall die in his sinne, and his righteous deedes, which he hath done, shall not be remembred: but his blood will I require at thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, if thou admonish that righteous man, that the righteous sinne not, and that he doeth not sinne, he shall liue because he is admonished: also thou hast deliuered thy soule.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the hande of the Lord was there vpon me, and he said vnto me, Arise, and goe into the fielde, and I will there talke with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So when I had risen vp, and gone foorth into the fielde, beholde, the glorie of the Lord stoode there, as the glorie which I sawe by the riuer Chebar, and I fell downe vpon my face.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the Spirit entred into me, which set me vp vpon my feete, and spake vnto me, and said to me, Come, and shut thy selfe within thine house.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But thou, O sonne of man, beholde, they shall put bandes vpon thee, and shall binde thee with them, and thou shalt not goe out among them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will make thy tongue cleaue to the roofe of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dume, and shalt not be to them as a man that rebuketh: for they are a rebellious house.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But when I shall haue spoken vnto thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, He that heareth, let him heare, and he that leaueth off, let him leaue: for they are a rebellious house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
