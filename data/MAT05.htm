It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be troden vnder foote of men.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Ye are the light of the world. A citie that is set on an hill, cannot be hid.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Neither doe men light a candel, and put it vnder a bushel, but on a candlesticke, and it giueth light vnto all that are in the house.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Think not that I am come to destroy the Lawe, or the Prophets. I am not come to destroy them, but to fulfill them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For truely I say vnto you, Till heauen, and earth perish, one iote or one title of the Law shall not scape, till all things be fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whosoeuer therefore shall breake one of these least commandements, and teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdome of heauen: but whosoeuer shall obserue and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdome of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For I say vnto you, except your righteousnes exceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharises, ye shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Ye haue heard that it was sayd vnto them of the olde time, Thou shalt not kill: for whosoeuer killeth shalbe culpable of iudgement.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But I say vnto you, whosoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduisedly, shalbe culpable of iudgment. And whosoeuer sayth vnto his brother, Raca, shalbe worthy to be punished by the Councill. And whosoeuer shall say, Foole, shalbe worthy to be punished with hell fire.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If then thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Leaue there thine offring before the altar, and goe thy way: first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Agree with thine aduersarie quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him, lest thine aduersarie deliuer thee to the Iudge, and the Iudge deliuer thee to ye sergeant, and thou be cast into prison.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto thee, thou shalt not come out thence, till thou hast payed the vtmost farthing.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Ye haue heard that it was sayd to them of olde time, Thou shalt not commit adulterie.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Wherefore if thy right eye cause thee to offend, plucke it out, and cast it from thee: for better it is for thee, that one of thy members perish, then that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Also if thy right hand make thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for better it is for thee that one of thy members perish, then that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It hath bene sayd also, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, let him giue her a bill of diuorcement.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But I say vnto you, whosoeuer shall put away his wife (except it be for fornication) causeth her to commit adulterie: and whosoeuer shall marrie her that is diuorced, committeth adulterie.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Againe, ye haue heard that it was sayd to them of old time, Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe, but shalt performe thine othes to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But I say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Nor yet by the earth: for it is his footestoole: neither by Hierusalem: for it is the citie of the great King.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Neither shalt thou sweare by thine head, because thou canst not make one heare white or blacke.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But let your communication be Yea, yea: Nay, nay. For whatsoeuer is more then these, commeth of euill.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Ye haue heard that it hath bene sayd, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But I say vnto you, Resist not euill: but whosoeuer shall smite thee on thy right cheeke, turne to him the other also.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And if any man wil sue thee at the law, and take away thy coate, let him haue thy cloke also.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And whosoeuer will compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Giue to him that asketh, and from him that would borowe of thee, turne not away.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Ye haue heard that it hath bin said, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, and hate your enemie.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>But I say vnto you, Loue your enemies: blesse them that curse you: doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which hurt you, and persecute you,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>That ye may be the children of your father that is in heauen: for he maketh his sunne to arise on the euill, and the good, and sendeth raine on the iust, and vniust.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For if ye loue them, which loue you, what rewarde shall you haue? Doe not the Publicanes euen the same?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And if ye be friendly to your brethren onely, what singular thing doe ye? doe not euen the Publicanes likewise?  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Ye shall therefore be perfit, as your Father which is in heauen, is perfite. </div><ul class='tnav'>
