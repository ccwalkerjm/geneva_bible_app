To morowe, sayd he, thou shalt heare him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And on the morowe when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pompe, and were entred into the Common hall with the chiefe captaines and chiefe men of the citie, at Festus commandement Paul was brought forth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Festus sayd, King Agrippa, and all men which are present with vs, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Iewes haue called vpon me, both at Hierusalem, and here, crying, that he ought not to liue any longer.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Yet haue I found nothing worthy of death, that he hath committed: neuertheles, seeing that he hath appealed to Augustus, I haue determined to send him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Of whome I haue no certaine thing to write vnto my Lord: wherefore I haue brought him forth vnto you, and specially vnto thee, King Agrippa, that after examination had, I might haue somewhat to write.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For me thinketh it vnreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to shewe the causes which are layde against him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
