My voyce came to God, when I cryed: my voyce came to God, and he heard me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In the day of my trouble I sought ye Lord: my sore ranne and ceased not in the night: my soule refused comfort.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I did thinke vpon God, and was troubled: I praied, and my spirit was full of anguish. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Thou keepest mine eyes waking: I was astonied and could not speake.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then I considered the daies of olde, and the yeeres of ancient time.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I called to remembrance my song in the night: I communed with mine owne heart, and my spirit searched diligently.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Will the Lord absent him selfe for euer? and will he shewe no more fauour?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Is his mercie cleane gone for euer? doeth his promise faile for euermore?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Hath God forgotten to be mercifull? hath he shut vp his teder mercies in displeasure? Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I sayde, This is my death: yet I remembred the yeeres of the right hand of the most High.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I remembred the workes of the Lord: certainely I remembred thy wonders of olde.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I did also meditate all thy woorkes, and did deuise of thine actes, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thy way, O God, is in the Sanctuarie: who is so great a God as our God!  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou art ye God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy power among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou hast redeemed thy people with thine arme, euen the sonnes of Iaakob and Ioseph. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The waters sawe thee, O God: the waters sawe thee, and were afraide: yea, the depths trembled.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The cloudes powred out water: the heauens gaue a sounde: yea, thine arrowes went abroade.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The voyce of thy thunder was rounde about: the lightnings lightened the worlde: the earth trembled and shooke.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thy way is in the Sea, and thy paths in the great waters, and thy footesteps are not knowen.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou diddest leade thy people like sheepe by the hand of Moses and Aaron. </div><ul class='tnav'>
