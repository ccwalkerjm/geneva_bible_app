And the Angel of the Lord was by the threshing place of Araunah the Iebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Dauid spake vnto the Lord (when he sawe the Angel that smote the people) and saide, Behold, I haue sinned, yea, I haue done wickedly: but these sheepe, what haue they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against mee and against my fathers house.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So Gad came the same day to Dauid, and said vnto him, Go vp, reare an altar vnto the Lord in the threshing floore of Araunah the Iebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Dauid (according to the saying of Gad) went vp, as the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Araunah looked, and sawe the King and his seruants comming towarde him, and Araunah went out, and bowed himselfe before the King on his face to the ground,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the King come to his seruant? Then Dauid answered, To bye the threshing floore of thee for to builde an altar vnto the Lord, that the plague may cease from the people.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Araunah saide vnto Dauid, Let my lord the King take and offer what seemeth him good in his eyes: beholde the oxen for the burnt offring, and charets, and the instruments of the oxen for wood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>(All these things did Araunah as a King giue vnto the King: and Araunah saide vnto the King, The Lord thy God be fauourable vnto thee)  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the King saide vnto Araunah, Not so, but I will bye it of thee at a price, and will not offer burnt offring vnto ye Lord my God of that which doeth cost me nothing. So Dauid bought the threshing floore, and the oxen for fiftie shekels of siluer.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Dauid built there an altar vnto the Lord, and offred burnt offrings and peace offrings, and the Lord was appeased toward ye lande, and the plague ceased from Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
