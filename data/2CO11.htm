God knoweth.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But what I doe, that will I doe: that I may cut away occasion from them which desire occasion, that they might be found like vnto vs in that wherein they reioyce.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For such false apostles are deceitfull workers, and transforme themselues into the Apostles of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And no marueile: for Satan himselfe is transformed into an Angel of light.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore it is no great thing, though his ministers transforme themselues, as though they were the ministers of righteousnes, whose end shall be according to their workes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I say againe, Let no man thinke that I am foolish, or els take mee euen as a foole, that I also may boast my selfe a litle.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>That I speake, I speake it not after the Lord: but as it were foolishly, in this my great boasting.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Seeing that many reioyce after the flesh, I will reioyce also.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For ye suffer fooles gladly, because that yee are wise.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For ye suffer, euen if a man bring you into bondage, if a man deuoure you, if a man take your goods, if a man exalt himselfe, if a man smite you on the face.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I speake as concerning the reproche: as though that we had bene weake: but wherein any man is bold (I speake foolishly) I am bold also.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They are Hebrues, so am I: they are Israelites, so am I: they are the seede of Abraham, so am I:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They are the ministers of Christ (I speake as a foole) I am more: in labours more aboundant: in stripes aboue measure: in prison more plenteously: in death oft.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Of the Iewes fiue times receiued I fourtie stripes saue one.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I was thrise beaten with roddes: I was once stoned: I suffered thrise shipwracke: night and day haue I bene in the deepe sea.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In iourneying I was often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of mine owne nation, in perils among the Gentiles, in perils in the citie, in perils in wildernes, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In wearinesse and painefulnesse, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in colde and in nakednesse.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Beside the thinges which are outwarde, I am combred dayly, and haue the care of all the Churches.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Who is weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burne not?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>If I must needes reioyce, I will reioyce of mine infirmities.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which is blessed for euermore, knoweth that I lie not.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>In Damascus the gouernour of the people vnder King Aretas, layde watch in the citie of the Damascens, and would haue caught me.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But at a window was I let downe in a basket through the wall, and escaped his handes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
