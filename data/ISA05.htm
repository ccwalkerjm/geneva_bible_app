Surely many houses shall be desolate, euen great, and faire without inhabitant.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For ten acres of vines shall yelde one bath, and the seede of an homer shall yelde an ephah.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wo vnto them, that rise vp early to follow drunkennes, and to them that continue vntill night, till the wine doe inflame them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the harpe and viole, timbrel, and pipe, and wine are in their feastes: but they regard not the worke of the Lord, neither consider the worke of his handes.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore my people is gone into captiuitie, because they had no knowledge, and the glorie thereof are men famished, and the multitude thereof is dried vp with thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore hell hath inlarged it selfe, and hath opened his mouth, without measure, and their glorie, and their multitude, and their pompe, and hee that reioyceth among them, shall descend into it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And man shalbe brought downe, and man shalbe humbled, euen the eyes of the proude shalbe humbled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord of hostes shalbe exalted in iudgement, and the holy God shalbe sanctified in iustice.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then shall the lambes feede after their maner, and the strangers shall eate the desolate places of the fat.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Woe vnto them, that draw iniquitie with cordes of vanitie, and sinne, as with cart ropes:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Which say, Let him make speede: let him hasten his worke, that wee may see it: and let the counsell of the holy one of Israel draw neere and come, that we may knowe it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Woe vnto them that speake good of euill, and euill of good, which put darkenes for light, and light for darkenes, that put bitter for sweete, and sweete for sowre.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Woe vnto them that are wise in their owne eyes, and prudent in their owne sight.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wo vnto them that are mightie to drinke wine, and to them that are strong to powre in strong drinke:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Which iustifie the wicked for a rewarde, and take away the righteousnesse of the righteous from him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore as the flame of fire deuoureth the stubble, and as the chaffe is cosumed of the flame: so their roote shalbe as rottennesse, and their bud shall rise vp like dust, because they haue cast off the Lawe of the Lord of hostes, and contemned the word of the holy one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and hee hath stretched out his hand vpon them, and hath smitten them that the mountaines did tremble: and their carkases were torne in the middes of the streetes, and for all this his wrath was not turned away, but his hande was stretched out still.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he will lift vp a signe vnto the nations a farre, and wil hisse vnto them from the ende of the earth: and beholde, they shall come hastily with speede.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>None shall faint nor fall among them: none shall slumber nor sleepe, neither shall the girdle of his loynes be loosed, nor the latchet of his shooes be broken:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Whose arrowes shall be sharpe, and all his bowes bent: his horse hoofes shall be thought like flint, and his wheeles like a whirlewinde.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>His roaring shalbe like a lyon, and he shall roare like lyons whelpes: they shall roare, and lay holde of the praye: they shall take it away, and none shall deliuer it.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And in that day they shall roare vpon them, as the roaring of the sea: and if they looke vnto the earth, beholde darkenesse, and sorowe, and the light shalbe darkened in their skie. </div><ul class='tnav'>
