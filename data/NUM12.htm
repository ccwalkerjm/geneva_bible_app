Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speake against my seruant, euen against Moses?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thus the Lord was very angrie with them, and departed.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Also the cloude departed from the Tabernacle: and beholde, Miriam was leprous like snowe: and Aaron looked vpon Miriam, and beholde, she was leprous.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Aaron saide vnto Moses, Alas, my Lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sinne vpon vs, which we haue foolishly committed and wherein we haue sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let her not, I pray thee, be as one dead, of whome the flesh is halfe consumed, when he commeth out of his mothers wombe.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Moses cryed vnto the Lord, saying, O God, I beseech thee, heale her nowe.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord said vnto Moses, If her father had spit in her face, shoulde she not haue bene ashamed seuen dayes? let her be shut out of the hoste seuen dayes, and after she shall bee receiued.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So Miriam was shut out of the hoste seuen dayes, and the people remooued not, till Miriam was brought in againe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
