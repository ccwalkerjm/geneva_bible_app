Olde things are passed away: beholde, all things are become newe.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And all things are of God, which hath reconciled vs vnto himselfe by Iesus Christ, and hath giuen vnto vs the ministerie of reconciliation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For God was in Christ, and reconciled the world to himselfe, not imputing their sinnes vnto them, and hath committed to vs the word of reconciliation.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now then are we ambassadours for Christ: as though God did beseeche you through vs, we pray you in Christes steade, that ye be reconciled to God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For he hath made him to be sinne for vs, which knewe no sinne, that we should be made the righteousnesse of God in him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
