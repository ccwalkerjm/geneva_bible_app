children of Israel, and say vnto them, I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>After ye doings of the land of Egypt, wherin ye dwelt, shall ye not doe: and after the maner of the land of Canaan, whither I will bring you, shall ye not do, neither walke in their ordinances,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But do after my iudgements, and keepe mine ordinances, to walke therein: I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Ye shall keepe therefore my statutes, and my iudgements, which if a man doe, he shall then liue in them: I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>None shall come neere to any of ye kinred of his flesh to vncouer her shame: I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy father, nor the shame of thy mother: for she is thy mother, thou shalt not discouer her shame.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The shame of thy fathers wife shalt thou not discouer: for it is thy fathers shame.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy sister the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether shee bee borne at home, or borne without: thou shalt not discouer their shame.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The shame of thy sonnes daughter, or of thy daughters daughter, thou shalt not, I say, vncouer their shame: for it is thy shame.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The shame of thy fathers wiues daughter, begotten of thy father (for she is thy sister) thou shalt not, I say, discouer her shame.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy fathers sister: for she is thy fathers kinswoman.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy mothers sister: for she is thy mothers kinsewoman.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy fathers brother: that is, thou shalt not goe in to his wife, for she is thine aunte.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy daughter in lawe: for she is thy sonnes wife: therefore shalt thou not vncouer her shame.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy brothers wife. for it is thy brothers shame.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou shalt not discouer the shame of the wife and of her daughter, neither shalt thou take her sonnes daughter, nor her daughters daughter, to vncouer her shame: for they are thy kinsfolkes, and it were wickednesse.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Also thou shalt not take a wife with her sister, during her life, to vexe her, in vncouering her shame vpon her.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou shalt not also go vnto a woman to vncouer her shame, as long as she is put apart for her disease.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moreouer, thou shalt not giue thy selfe to thy neighbours wife by carnall copulation, to be defiled with her.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Also thou shalt not giue thy children to offer them vnto Molech, neither shalt thou defile the name of thy God: for I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thou shalt not lie with ye male as one lieth with a woman: for it is abomination.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thou shalt not also lie with any beast to bee defiled therewith, neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie downe thereto: for it is abomination.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Yee shall not defile your selues in any of these things: for in al these the nations are defiled, which I will cast out before you:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the land is defiled: therefore I wil visit the wickednesse thereof vpon it, and the lande shall vomit out her inhabitants.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Ye shall keepe therefore mine ordinances, and my iudgements, and commit none of these abominations, aswell hee that is of the same countrey, as the straunger that soiourneth among you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>(For all these abominations haue the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And shall not the lande spue you out if ye defile it, as it spued out the people that were before you?)  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For whosoeuer shall commit any of these abominations, the persons that doe so, shall bee cut off from among their people.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore shall yee keepe mine ordinances that ye do not any of the abominable customes, which haue bene done before you, and that yee defile not your selues therein: for I am the Lord your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
