and say vnto him, When thou lightest the lampes, the seuen lampes shall giue light towarde the forefront of the Candlesticke.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Aaron did so, lighting the lampes thereof towarde ye forefront of the Candlesticke, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And this was the worke of the Candlesticke, euen of golde beaten out with the hammer, both the shafte, and the flowres thereof was beaten out with the hammer: according to the paterne, which the Lord had shewed Moses, so made he the Candlesticke.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Take the Leuites from among the children of Israel, and purifie them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thus shalt thou doe vnto them, when thou purifiest them, Sprinckle water of purification vpon them, and let them shaue all their flesh, and wash their clothes: so they shalbe cleane.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then they shall take a yong bullocke with his meate offring of fine floure, mingled with oyle, and another yong bullocke shalt thou take for a sinne offring.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then thou shalt bring the Leuites before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and asseble all the Congregation of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou shalt bring the Leuites also before the Lord, and the children of Israel shall put their handes vpon the Leuites.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Aaron shall offer the Leuites before the Lord, as a shake offring of ye childre of Israel, that they may execute the seruice of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Leuites shall put their handes vpon the heades of the bullockes, and make thou the one a sinne offring, and the other a burnt offring vnto the Lord, that thou mayest make an atonement for the Leuites.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt set the Leuites before Aaron and before his sonnes, and offer the as a shake offring to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus thou shalt separate the Leuites from among the children of Israel, and the Leuites shall be mine.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And afterwarde shall the Leuites goe in, to serue in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou shalt purifie them and offer them, as a shake offering.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For they are freely giuen vnto me from among the children of Israel, for such as open any wombe: for all the first borne of the children of Israel haue I taken them vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For all the first borne of the children of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast: since the day that I smote euery first borne in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for my selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I haue taken the Leuites for all the first borne of the children of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And haue giuen the Leuites as a gift vnto Aaron, and to his sonnes from among the children of Israel, to do the seruice of the children of Israel in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come neere vnto the Sanctuarie.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Moses and Aaron and all the Cogregation of the children of Israel did with the Leuites, according vnto all that the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Leuites: so did the children of Israel vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the Leuites were purified, and washed their clothes, and Aaron offred them as a shake offring before the Lord, and Aaron made an atonement for them, to purifie them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And after that, went the Leuites in to doe their seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before Aaron and before his sonnes: as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Leuites, so they did vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>This also belongeth to the Leuites: from fiue and twentie yeere olde and vpwarde, they shall goe in, to execute their office in the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And after the age of fiftie yeere, they shall cease from executing the office, and shall serue no more:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But they shall minister with their brethre in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to keepe things committed to their charge, but they shall doe no seruice: thus shalt thou doe vnto the Leuites touching their charges.
