Ye haue heaped vp treasure for the last dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Behold, the hire of ye labourers, which haue reaped your fieldes (which is of you kept backe by fraude) cryeth, and the cryes of them which haue reaped, are entred into the eares of the Lord of hostes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Ye haue liued in pleasure on the earth, and in wantonnes. Ye haue nourished your heartes, as in a day of slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Ye haue condemned and haue killed the iust, and he hath not resisted you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Be patient therefore, brethren, vnto the comming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman wayteth for the precious fruite of the earth, and hath long patience for it, vntill he receiue the former, and the latter rayne.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Be ye also patient therefore and settle your hearts: for ye comming of the Lord draweth neere.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Grudge not one against another, brethren, least ye be condemned: behold, the iudge standeth before the doore.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Take, my brethren, the Prophets for an ensample of suffering aduersitie, and of long patience, which haue spoken in the Name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Beholde, we count them blessed which endure. Ye haue heard of the patience of Iob, and haue knowen what ende the Lord made. For the Lord is very pitifull and mercifull.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But before all thinges, my brethren, sweare not, neither by heauen, nor by earth, nor by any other othe: but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay, lest ye fall into condemnation.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any merie? Let him sing.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Is any sicke among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and anoynt him with oyle in the Name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the prayer of faith shall saue the sicke, and the Lord shall raise him vp: and if he haue committed sinnes, they shalbe forgiuen him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Acknowledge your faultes one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed: for the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Helias was a man subiect to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rayne, and it rayned not on the earth for three yeeres and sixe moneths.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he prayed againe, and the heauen gaue rayne, and the earth brought forth her fruite.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Brethren, if any of you hath erred from the trueth, and some man hath conuerted him,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Let him know that he which hath conuerted the sinner from going astray out of his way, shall saue a soule from death, and shall hide a multitude of sinnes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
