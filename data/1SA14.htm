Then Ionathan said vnto his armour bearer, Come vp after me: for the Lord hath deliuered them into the hand of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So Ionathan went vp vpon his hands and vpon his feete, and his armour bearer after him: and some fell before Ionathan, and his armour bearer slewe others after him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the first slaughter which Ionathan and his armour bearer made, was about twentie men, as it were within halfe an acre of land which two oxen plowe.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And there was a feare in the hoste, and in the field, and among all the people: the garison also, and they that went out to spoyle, were afraid themselues: and the earth trembled: for it was striken with feare by God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Beniamin sawe: and beholde, the multitude was discomfited, and smitten as they went.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore saide Saul vnto the people that were with him, Search nowe and see, who is gone from vs. And when they had nombred, beholde, Ionathan and his armour bearer were not there.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Saul said vnto Ahiah, Bring hither the Arke of God (for the Arke of God was at that time with the children of Israel)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And while Saul talked vnto the Priest, the noyse that was in the hoste of the Philistims, spred farther abroade, and encreased: therefore Saul said vnto the Priest, Withdraw thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Saul was assembled with all the people that were with him, and they came to the battell: and behold, euery mans sworde was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Moreouer, the Ebrewes that were with the Philistims beforetime, and were come with them into all partes of the hoste, euen they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Ionathan.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Also all the men of Israel which had hid themselues in mount Ephraim, when they heard, that the Philistims were fled, they followed after them in the battell.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And so the Lord saued Israel that day: and the battell continued vnto Beth-auen.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And at that time the men of Israel were pressed with hunger: for Saul charged the people with an othe, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth foode till night, that I may be auenged of mine enemies: so none of the people tasted any sustenance.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And all they of the land came to a wood, where hony lay vpon the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the people came into the wood, and beholde, the hony dropped, and no man mooued his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the othe.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Ionathan heard not when his father charged the people with the othe: wherefore he put foorth the ende of the rod that was in his hand, and dipt it in an hony combe, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes receiued sight.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father made the people to sweare, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth sustenance this day: and the people were faint.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then said Ionathan, My father hath troubled the land: see nowe howe mine eyes are made cleare, because I haue tasted a litle of this honie:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Howe much more, if the people had eaten to day of the spoyle of their enemies which they found? for had there not bene nowe a greater slaughter among the Philistims?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they smote the Philistims that day, from Michmash to Aiialon: and the people were exceeding faint.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So the people turned to the spoile, and tooke sheepe, and oxen, and calues, and slewe them on the ground, and the people did eate them with the blood.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then men tolde Saul, saying, Beholde, the people sinne against the Lord, in that they eate with the blood. And he saide, Ye haue trespassed: roule a great stone vnto me this day.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Againe Saul said, Goe abroade among the people, and bid them bring me euery man his oxe, and euery man his sheepe, and slay them here, and eate and sinne not against the Lord in eating with the blood. And ye people brought euery man his oxe in his hand that night, and slew them there.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Saul made an altar vnto the Lord, and that was the first altar that he made vnto the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Saul saide, Let vs goe downe after the Philistims by night, and spoyle them vntill the morning shine, and let vs not leaue a man of them. And they saide, Doe whatsoeuer thou thinkest best. Then saide the Priest, Let vs drawe neere hither vnto God.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So Saul asked of God, saying, Shall I goe downe after ye Philistims? wilt thou deliuer them into the hands of Israel? But he answered him not at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Saul said, All ye chiefe of the people, come ye hither, and knowe, and see by whom this sinne is done this day.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For as the Lord liueth, which saueth Israel, though it be done by Ionathan my sonne, he shall dye the death. But none of all the people answered him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then he saide vnto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Ionathan my sonne will be on the other side. And the people saide vnto Saul, Doe what thou thinkest best.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then Saul said vnto the Lord God of Israel, Giue a perfite lot. And Ionathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Saul saide, Cast lot betweene me and Ionathan my sonne. And Ionathan was taken.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then Saul said to Ionathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Ionathan tolde him, and said, I tasted a litle hony with the ende of the rod, that was in mine hand, and loe, I must die.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Againe Saul answered, God doe so and more also, vnlesse thou die the death, Ionathan.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And the people said vnto Saul, Shall Ionathan die, who hath so mightily deliuered Israel? God forbid. As the Lord liueth, there shall not one heare of his head fall to the ground: for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people deliuered Ionathan that he dyed not.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then Saul came vp from the Philistims: and the Philistims went to their owne place.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>So Saul helde the kingdome ouer Israel, and fought against all his enemies on euery side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the Kings of Zobah, and against the Philistims: and whithersoeuer he went, he handled them as wicked men.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He gathered also an hoste and smote Amalek, and deliuered Israel out of the handes of them that spoyled them.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Nowe the sonnes of Saul were Ionathan, and Ishui, and Malchishua: and the names of his two daughters, the elder was called Merab, and the yonger was named Michal.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And the name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of his chiefe captaine was Abner the sonne of Ner, Sauls vncle.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And Kish was Sauls father: and Ner the father of Abner was the sonne of Abiel.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And there was sore warre against the Philistims all the dayes of Saul: and whomsoeuer Saul sawe to be a strong man, and meete for the warre, he tooke him vnto him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
