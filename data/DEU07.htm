 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou shalt not feare them, but remember what the Lord thy God did vnto Pharaoh, and vnto all Egypt:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The great tentations which thine eyes sawe, and the signes and wonders, and the mighty hand and stretched out arme, whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out: so shall the Lord thy God do vnto all ye people, whose face thou fearest.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moreouer, the Lord thy God will send hornets among them vntil they that are left, and hide themselues from thee, be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt not feare them: for the Lord thy God is among you, a God mightie and dreadful.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord thy God wil roote out these nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, least the beasts of the fielde increase vpon thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the Lord thy God shall giue them before thee, and shall destroy them with a mightie destruction, vntill they be brought to naught.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he shall deliuer their Kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from vnder heauen: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, vntill thou hast destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The grauen images of their gods shall ye burne with fire, and couet not the siluer and golde, that is on them, nor take it vnto thee, least thou be snared therewith: for it is an abomination before the Lord thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Bring not therefore abomination into thine house, lest, thou be accursed like it, but vtterly abhorre it, and count it most abominable: for it is accursed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
