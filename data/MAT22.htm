<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Iesus answered, and spake vnto them againe in parables, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine King which maried his sonne,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And sent foorth his seruants, to call them that were bidde to the wedding, but they woulde not come.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Againe hee sent foorth other seruants, saying. Tell them which are bidden, Beholde, I haue prepared my dinner: mine oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all thinges are readie: come vnto the mariage.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they made light of it, and went their wayes, one to his farme, and another about his marchandise.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the remnant tooke his seruants, and intreated them sharpely, and slewe them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But when the King heard it, he was wroth, and sent foorth his warriers, and destroyed those murtherers, and burnt vp their citie.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then saide hee to his seruants, Truely the wedding is prepared: but they which were bidden, were not worthy.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Go ye therefore out into the high wayes, and as many as ye finde, bid them to the mariage.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So those seruantes went out into the hie wayes, and gathered together all that euer they found, both good and bad: so the wedding was furnished with ghestes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then the King came in, to see the ghestes, and sawe there a man which had not on a wedding garment.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he sayd vnto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, and hast not on a wedding garment? And he was speachlesse.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then sayd the King to the seruants, Binde him hand and foote: take him away, and cast him into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For many are called, but fewe chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then went the Pharises and tooke counsell how they might tangle him in talke.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they sent vnto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we knowe that thou art true, and teachest the way of God truely, neither carest for any man: for thou considerest not the person of men.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Tell vs therefore, how thinkest thou? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or not?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Iesus perceiued their wickednes, and sayd, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Shewe me the tribute money. And they brought him a peny.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he sayde vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They sayd vnto him, Cesars. Then sayd he vnto them, Giue therefore to Cesar, the things which are Cesars, and giue vnto God, those things which are Gods.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when they heard it, they marueiled, and left him, and went their way.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The same day the Sadduces came to him (which say that there is no resurrection) and asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Saying, Master, Moses sayd, If a man die, hauing no children, his brother shall marie his wife by the right of alliance, and raise vp seede vnto his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Nowe there were with vs seuen brethren, and the first maried a wife, and deceased: and hauing none yssue, left his wife vnto his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Likewise also the second, and the third, vnto the seuenth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And last of all the woman died also.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seuen? for all had her.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Ye are deceiued, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For in the resurrection they neither marie wiues, nor wiues are bestowed in mariage, but are as the Angels of God in heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And concerning the resurrection of the dead, haue ye not read what is spoken vuto you of God, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when the multitude heard it, they were astonied at his doctrine.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But when the Pharises had heard, that he had put the Sadduces to silence, they assembled together.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And one of them, which was an expounder of the Lawe, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Master, which is ye great commandement in the Lawe?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Iesus sayd to him, Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy minde.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>This is the first and the great commandement.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the second is like vnto this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>On these two commandements hangeth the whole Lawe, and the Prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>While the Pharises were gathered together, Iesus asked them,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Saying, What thinke ye of Christ? whose sonne is he? They sayd vnto him, Dauids.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>He sayd vnto them, How then doeth Dauid in spirit call him Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>The Lord sayd to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footestoole?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>If then Dauid call him Lord, howe is he his sonne?  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And none could answere him a worde, neither durst any from that day foorth aske him any moe questions. </div><ul class='tnav'>
