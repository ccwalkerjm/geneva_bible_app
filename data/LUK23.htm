And hee answered him, and sayd, Thou sayest it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then sayd Pilate to the hie Priests, and to the people, I finde no fault in this man.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they were the more fierce, saying, He moueth the people, teaching throughout all Iudea, beginning at Galile, euen to this place.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Nowe when Pilate heard of Galile, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when he knewe that he was of Herods iurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, which was also at Hierusalem in those dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when Herod sawe Iesus, hee was exceedingly glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him, and trusted to haue seene some signe done by him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then questioned hee with him of many things: but he answered him nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The hie Priests also and Scribes stood forth, and accused him vehemently.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Herod with his men of warre, despised him, and mocked him, and arayed him in white, and sent him againe to Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were enemies one to another.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Pilate called together the hie Priests and the rulers, and the people,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And sayd vnto them, Ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerted the people: and beholde, I haue examined him before you, and haue found no fault in this man, of those things whereof ye accuse him:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him: and loe, nothing worthy of death is done of him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will therefore chastise him, and let him loose.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>(For of necessitie hee must haue let one loose vnto them at the feast.)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then all ye multitude cried at once, saying, Away with him, and deliuer vnto vs Barabbas:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Which for a certaine insurrection made in the citie, and murder, was cast in prison.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Pilate spake againe to them, willing to let Iesus loose.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But they cried, saying, Crucifie, crucifie him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he sayd vnto them the third time, But what euill hath he done? I finde no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him loose.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they were instant with loude voyces, and required that he might be crucified: and the voyces of them and of the hie Priests preuailed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Pilate gaue sentence, that it should be as they required.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he let loose vnto them him that for insurrection and murder was cast into prison, whome they desired, and deliuered Iesus to doe with him what they would.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And as they led him away, they caught one Simon of Cyrene, comming out of the fielde, and on him they layde the crosse, to beare it after Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, which women bewailed and lamented him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But Iesus turned backe vnto them, and said, Daughters of Hierusalem, weepe not for me, but weepe for your selues, and for your children.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For behold, the dayes wil come, when men shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombes that neuer bare, and the pappes which neuer gaue sucke.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then shall they begin to say to the mountaines, Fall on vs: and to the hilles, Couer vs.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For if they doe these things to a greene tree, what shalbe done to the drie?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And there were two others, which were euill doers, led with him to be slaine.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when they were come to the place, which is called Caluarie, there they crucified him, and the euill doers: one at the right hand, and the other at the left.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then sayd Iesus, Father, forgiue them: for they know not what they doe. And they parted his raiment, and cast lottes.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the people stoode, and behelde: and the rulers mocked him with them, saying, He saued others: let him saue himselfe, if hee be that Christ, the Chosen of God.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The souldiers also mocked him, and came and offered him vineger,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And said, If thou be the King of the Iewes, saue thy selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And a superscription was also written ouer him, in Greeke letters, and in Latin, and in Hebrewe, THIS IS THAT KING OF THE JEWES.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And one of the euill doers, which were hanged, railed on him, saying, If thou be that Christ, saue thy selfe and vs.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But the other answered, and rebuked him, saying, Fearest thou not God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>We are in deede righteously here: for we receiue things worthy of that we haue done: but this man hath done nothing amisse.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And he sayd vnto Iesus, Lord, remember me, when thou commest into thy kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then Iesus said vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And it was about the sixt houre: and there was a darkenes ouer all the land, vntill the ninth houre.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And the Sunne was darkened, and the vaile of the Temple rent through the middes.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, and sayd, Father, into thine hands I commend my spirit. And when hee thus had sayd, hee gaue vp the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Nowe when the Centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Of a suretie this man was iust.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things, which were done, smote their brestes, and returned.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And all his acquaintance stood a farre off, and the women that followed him from Galile, beholding these things.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And beholde, there was a man named Ioseph, which was a counseller, a good man and a iust.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Hee did not consent to the counsell and deede of them, which was of Arimathea, a citie of the Iewes: who also himselfe waited for the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>He went vnto Pilate, and asked the body of Iesus,  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And tooke it downe, and wrapped it in a linnen cloth, and laide it in a tombe hewen out of a rocke, wherein was neuer man yet laide.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drewe on.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And the women also that followed after, which came with him from Galile, behelde the sepulchre, and how his body was layd.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And they returned and prepared odours, and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandement. </div><ul class='tnav'>
