So he deuided vnto them his substance.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So not many daies after, when the yonger sonne had gathered all together, hee tooke his iourney into a farre countrey, and there hee wasted his goods with riotous liuing.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nowe when hee had spent all, there arose a great dearth throughout that land, and he began to be in necessitie.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then hee went and claue to a citizen of that conntrey, and hee sent him to his farme, to feede swine.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And hee would faine haue filled his bellie with the huskes, that the swine ate: but no man gaue them him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then he came to him selfe, and said, Howe many hired seruaunts at my fathers haue bread ynough, and I die for hunger?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I wil rise and goe to my father, and say vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heaue, and before thee,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And am no more worthy to be called thy sonne: make me as one of thy hired seruants.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So hee arose and came to his father, and when hee was yet a great way off, his father sawe him, and had compassion, and ranne and fell on his necke, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the sonne sayde vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen, and before thee, and am no more worthie to be called thy sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then the father said to his seruaunts, Bring foorth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feete,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And bring the fat calfe, and kill him, and let vs eate, and be merie:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For this my sonne was dead, and is aliue againe: and he was lost, but he is found. And they began to be merie.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Nowe the elder brother was in the fielde, and when he came and drewe neere to the house, he heard melodie, and dauncing,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And called one of his seruaunts, and asked what those things meant.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And hee sayde vnto him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatte calfe, because he hath receiued him safe and sound.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then he was angry, and would not goe in: therefore came his father out and entreated him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But he answered and said to his father, Loe, these many yeeres haue I done thee seruice, neither brake I at any time thy commadement, and yet thou neuer gauest mee a kidde that I might make merie with my friends.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But when this thy sonne was come, which hath deuoured thy good with harlots, thou hast for his sake killed the fat calfe.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said vnto him, Sonne, thou art euer with me, and al that I haue, is thine. It was meete that we shoulde make merie, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is aliue againe: and hee was lost, but he is found. </div><ul class='tnav'>
