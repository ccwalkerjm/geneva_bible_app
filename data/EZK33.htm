O ye house of Israel, I will iudge you euery one after his waies.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Also in the twelfth yere of our captiuitie, in the tenth moneth, and in the fift day of the moneth, one that had escaped out of Ierusalem, came vnto me, and said, The citie is smitten.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now the hand of the Lord had bene vpon me in ye euening afore hee that had escaped, came, and had opened my mouth vntill he came to me in the morning: and when hee had opened my mouth, I was no more dumme.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me, and saide,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Sonne of man, these that dwel in the desolate places of the land of Israel, talke and say, Abraham was but one, and hee possessed the lande: but we are many, therefore the lande shall be giuen vs in possession.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Wherefore say vnto them, Thus saieth the Lord God, Ye eate with the blood, and lift vp your eyes towarde your idoles, and sheade blood: should ye then possesse the land?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Ye leane vpon your swordes: ye worke abomination, and yee defile euery one his neighbours wife: should ye then possesse the land?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Say thus vnto them, Thus saieth the Lord God, As I liue, so surely they that are in the desolate places, shall fall by the sword: and him that is in the open field, will I giue vnto the beasts to be deuoured: and they that be in the forts and in the caues, shall die of the pestilence.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For I will lay the land desolate and waste, and the pompe of her strength shall cease: and the moutaines of Israel shalbe desolate, and none shall passe through.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then shall they know that I am the Lord, when I haue laid ye land desolate and wast, because of al their abominations, that they haue committed.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Also thou sonne of man, the children of thy people that talke of thee by the wals and in the dores of houses, and speake one to another, euery one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and heare what is the word that commeth from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For they come vnto thee, as the people vseth to come: and my people sit before thee, and heare thy wordes, but they will not doe them: for with their mouthes they make iestes, and their heart goeth after their couetousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And loe, thou art vnto them, as a iesting song of one that hath a pleasant voyce, and can sing well: for they heare thy woordes, but they doe them not.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when this commeth to passe (for loe, it will come) then shall they know, that a Prophet hath bene among them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
