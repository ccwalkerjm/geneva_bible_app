Shall the earth bee forsaken for thy sake? or the rocke remoued out of his place?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Yea, the light of the wicked shalbe quenched, and the sparke of his fire shall not shine.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The light shalbe darke in his dwelling, and his candle shalbe put out with him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The steps of his strength shalbe restrained, and his owne counsell shall cast him downe.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For hee is taken in the net by his feete, and he walketh vpon the snares.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The grenne shall take him by the heele, and the theefe shall come vpon him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A snare is layed for him in the ground, and a trappe for him in the way.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Fearefulnesse shall make him afrayde on euery side, and shall driue him to his feete.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His strength shalbe famine: and destruction shalbe readie at his side.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>It shall deuoure the inner partes of his skinne, and the first borne of death shall deuoure his strength.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>His hope shalbe rooted out of his dwelling, and shall cause him to go to the King of feare.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Feare shall dwell in his house (because it is not his) and brimstone shalbe scattered vpon his habitation.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>His rootes shalbe dryed vp beneath, and aboue shall his branche be cut downe.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall haue no name in the streete.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They shall driue him out of the light vnto darkenesse, and chase him out of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hee shall neither haue sonne nor nephewe among his people, nor any posteritie in his dwellings.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The posteritie shalbe astonied at his day, and feare shall come vpon the ancient.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Surely such are the habitations of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
