The booke of the vision of Nahum the Elkeshite.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God is ielous, and the Lord reuengeth: the Lord reuengeth: euen the Lord of anger, the Lord will take vengeance on his aduersaries, and he reserueth wrath for his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The Lord is slow to anger, but he is great in power, and will not surely cleare the wicked: the Lord hath his way in ye whirlewind, and in the storme, and the cloudes are the dust of his feete.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He rebuketh the sea, and dryeth it, and he dryeth vp all the riuers: Bashan is wasted and Carmel, and the floure of Lebanon is wasted.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The mountaines tremble for him, and the hilles melt, and the earth is burnt at his sight, yea, the worlde, and all that dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Who can stande before his wrath? or who can abide in the fiercenesse of his wrath? his wrath is powred out like fire, and the rockes are broken by him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lord is good and as a strong hold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them that trust in him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But passing ouer as with a flood, he will vtterly destroy the place thereof, and darknesse shall pursue his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What doe ye imagine against the Lord? he wil make an vtter destruction: affliction shall not rise vp the seconde time.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For he shall come as vnto thornes folden one in another, and as vnto drunkards in their drunkennesse: they shall be deuoured as stubble fully dryed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There commeth one out of thee that imagineth euill against the Lord, euen a wicked counsellour.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, Though they be quiet, and also many, yet thus shall they be cut off when he shall passe by: though I haue afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For nowe I will breake his yoke from thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord hath giuen a commandement concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sowen: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the grauen, and the molten image: I will make it thy graue for thee, for thou art vile.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Beholde vpon the mountaines the feete of him that declareth, and publisheth peace: O Iudah, keepe thy solemne feastes, perfourme thy vowes: for the wicked shall no more passe thorowe thee: he is vtterly cut off. </div><ul class='tnav'>
