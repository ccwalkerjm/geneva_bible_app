Why doth the land perish, and is burnt vp like a wildernesse, that none passeth through?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord sayeth, Because they haue forsaken my Lawe, which I set before them, and haue not obeyed my voice, neither walked thereafter,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But haue walked after the stubbernesse of their owne heart, and after Baalims, which their fathers taught them,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore thus sayth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feede this people with wormewood, and giue them waters of gall to drinke:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I wil scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers haue knowen, and I will send a sworde after them, til I haue consumed them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord of hostes, Take heede, and call for the mourning women, that they may come, and send for skilfull women that they may come,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And let them make haste, and let them take vp a lamentation for vs, that our eyes may cast out teares and our eye liddes gush out of water.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For a lamentable noyse is heard out of Zion, Howe are we destroyed, and vtterly confounded, for we haue forsaken the land, and our dwellings haue cast vs out.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore heare the worde of the Lord, O ye women, and let your eares regard the words of his mouth, and teach your daughters to mourne, and euery one her neighbour to lament.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For death is come vp into our windowes, and is entred into our palaces, to destroy the children without, and the yong men in the streetes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Speake, thus sayth the Lord, The carkeises of men shall lye, euen as the doung vpon the fielde, and as the handfull after the mower, and none shall gather them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisedome, nor the strong man glorie in his strength, neyther the riche man glorie in his riches.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But let him that glorieth, glorie in this, that he vnderstandeth, and knoweth me: for I am the Lord, which shewe mercie, iudgement, and righteousnes in the earth: for in these things I delite, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Beholde, the dayes come, sayth the Lord, that I wil visite all them, which are circumcised with the vncircumcised:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Egypt and Iudah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all the vtmost corners of them that dwell in the wildernesse: for all these nations are vncircumcised, and al the house of Israel are vncircumcised in the heart. </div><ul class='tnav'>
