And Hezekiah saide, They are come from a farre countrey vnto me, from Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then saide he, What haue they seene in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house haue they seene: there is nothing among my treasures, that I haue not shewed them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Isaiah saide to Hezekiah, Heare the worde of the Lord of hostes,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Beholde, the dayes come, that all that is in thine house, and which thy fathers haue layed vp in store vntill this day, shall be caried to Babel: nothing shall be left, sayeth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And of thy sonnes, that shall proceede out of thee, and which thou shalt beget, shall they take away, and they shall be eunuches in the palace of the King of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, The worde of the Lord is good, which thou hast spoken: and he saide, Yet let there be peace, and trueth in my dayes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
