Mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be troden downe as the myre of the streetes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This is ye day, that thy walles shalbe built: this day shall driue farre away the decree.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In this day also they shall come vnto thee from Asshur, and from the strong cities, and from the strong holdes euen vnto the riuer, and from Sea to Sea, and from mountaine to mountaine.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Notwithstanding, the lande shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, and for the fruites of their inuentions.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flocke of thine heritage (which dwell solitarie in the wood) as in the middes of Carmel: let them feede in Bashan and Gilead, as in olde time.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>According to the dayes of thy comming out of the lande of Egypt, will I shewe vnto him marueilous things.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The nations shall see, and be confounded for all their power: they shall lay their hande vpon their mouth: their eares shall be deafe.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They shall licke the dust like a serpent: they shall mooue out of their holes like wormes: they shalbe afraide of the Lord our God, and shall feare because of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Who is a God like vnto thee, that taketh away iniquitie, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage! He reteineth not his wrath for euer, because mercie pleaseth him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He will turne againe, and haue compassion vpon vs: he will subdue our iniquities, and cast all their sinnes into the bottome of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou wilt perfourme thy trueth to Iaakob, and mercie to Abraham, as thou hast sworne vnto our fathers in olde time. </div><ul class='tnav'>
