<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 35</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the plaine of Moab by Iorden, toward Iericho, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Commande ye children of Israel, that they giue vnto the Leuites of the inheritace of their possession, cities to dwell in: yee shall giue also vnto the Leuites the suburbes of the cities round about them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So they shall haue the cities to dwell in, and their suburbes shall be for their cattell, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the suburbes of the cities, which ye shall giue vnto the Leuites, from the wall of the citie outward, shalbe a thousand cubites round about.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And yee shall measure without the citie of the Eastside, two thousand cubites: and of the Southside, two thousand cubites: and of the Westside, two thousand cubites: and of ye Northside, two thousand cubites: and the citie shalbe in ye middes. this shalbe the measure of the suburbes of their cities.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And of the cities which yee shall giue vnto the Leuites, there shalbe sixe cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint, that he which killeth, may flee thither: and to them yee shall adde two and fourtie cities more.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>All the cities which yee shall giue to the Leuites, shalbe eight and fourtie cities: them shall ye giue with their suburbes.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And concerning the cities which yee shall giue, of the possession of the children of Israel: of many ye shall take more, and of few ye shall take lesse: euery one shall giue of his cities vnto the Leuites, according to his inheritance, which hee inheriteth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come ouer Iorden into the land of Canaan,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Ye shall appoint you cities, to bee cities of refuge for you, that the slayer, which slayeth any person vnwares, may flee thither.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And these cities shalbe for you a refuge from the auenger, that he which killeth, die not, vntill he stand before the Congregation in iudgement.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And of the cities which ye shall giue, sixe cities shall ye haue for refuge.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Ye shall appoint three on this side Iorden, and ye shall appoint three cities in the lande of Canaan which shalbe cities of refuge.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>These six cities shalbe a refuge for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for him that dwelleth among you, that euery one which killeth any person vnwares, may flee thither.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if one smite another with an instrument of yron that hee die, hee is a murtherer, and the murtherer shall die the death.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Also if hee smite him by casting a stone, wherewith hee may be slaine, and he die, hee is a murtherer, and the murtherer shall die the death.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may be slaine, if he die, he is a murtherer, and the murtherer shall die the death.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The reuenger of the blood himselfe shall slay the murtherer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if hee thrust him of hate, or hurle at him by laying of wait, that he die,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Or smite him through enimitie with his hand, that he die, he that smote him shall die ye death: for hee is a murtherer: the reuenger of the blood shall slay the murtherer when he meeteth him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But if he pusshed him vnaduisedly, and not of hatred, or cast vpon him any thing, without laying of waite,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Or any stone (whereby he might be slaine) and sawe him not, or caused it to fall vpon him, and he die, and was not his enemie, neither sought him any harme,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the Congregation shall iudge betweene the slayer and the auenger of blood according to these lawes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the Congregation shall deliuer the slayer out of the hande of the auenger of blood, and the Congregation shall restore him vnto the citie of his refuge, whither hee was fled: and hee shall abide there vnto the death of the hie Priest, which is anointed with the holy oyle.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But if the slayer come without the borders of the citie of his refuge, whither he was fled,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the reuenger of blood finde him without the borders of the citie of his refuge, and the reueger of blood slay ye murtherer, he shalbe giltles,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Because he should haue remained in the citie of his refuge, vntill the death of the hie Priest: and after the death of the hie Priest, the slayer shall returne vnto the land of his possession.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So these thinges shall be a lawe of iudgement vnto you, throughout your generations in all your dwellings.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Whosoeuer killeth any person, the Iudge shall slay the murtherer, through witnesses: but one witnesse shall not testifie against a person to cause him to die.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Moreouer ye shall take no recompense for the life of the murtherer, which is worthy to die: but he shalbe put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Also ye shall take no recompense for him that is fled to the citie of his refuge, that he should come againe, and dwell in the lande, before the death of the hie Priest.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye shall dwell: for blood defileth the land: and the land cannot be clensed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Defile not therefore the lande which yee shall inhabite, For I dwell in the middes thereof: for I the Lord dwel among the children of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
