Then they filled them vp to the brim.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he sayde vnto them, Draw out nowe and beare vnto the gouernour of the feast. So they bare it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Nowe when the gouernour of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, (for he knewe not whence it was: but the seruants, which drewe the water, knewe) the gouernour of ye feast called the bridegrome,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And saide vnto him, All men at the beginning set foorth good wine, and when men haue well drunke, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept backe the good wine vntill nowe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This beginning of miracles did Iesus in Cana a towne of Galile, and shewed forth his glorie: and his disciples beleeued on him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>After that, he went downe into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: but they continued not many daies there.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For the Iewes Passeouer was at hande. Therefore Iesus went vp to Hierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he found in the Temple those that sold oxen, and sheepe, and doues, and changers of money, sitting there.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then hee made a scourge of small cordes, and draue them all out of the Temple with the sheepe and oxen, and powred out the changers money, and ouerthrewe the tables,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And said vnto them that solde doues, Take these things hence: make not my fathers house, an house of marchandise.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And his disciples remembred, that it was written, The zeale of thine house hath eaten me vp.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then answered the Iewes, and saide vnto him, What signe shewest thou vnto vs, that thou doest these things?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Destroy this Temple, and in three daies I will raise it vp againe.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then said the Iewes, Fourtie and sixe yeeres was this Temple a building, and wilt thou reare it vp in three daies?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But he spake of the temple of his bodie.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Assoone therefore as he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembred that hee thus sayde vnto them: and they beleeued the Scripture, and the worde which Iesus had saide.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nowe when hee was at Hierusalem at the Passeouer in the feast, many beleeued in his Name, when they sawe his miracles which he did.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Iesus did not commit him selfe vnto them, because he knewe them all,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And had no neede that any should testifie of man: for he knewe what was in man. </div><ul class='tnav'>
