I will pray with the spirit, but I wil pray with the vnderstanding also: I wil sing with the spirite, but I will sing with the vnderstanding also.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Else, when thou blessest with the spirit, howe shall hee that occupieth the roome of the vnlearned, say Amen, at thy giuing of thankes, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thou verely giuest thankes well, but the other is not edified.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I thanke my God, I speake languages more then ye all.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet had I rather in the Church to speake fiue wordes with mine vnderstanding, that I might also instruct others, then ten thousande wordes in a strange tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Brethren, be not children in vnderstanding, but as concerning maliciousnes be children, but in vnderstanding be of a ripe age.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>In the Lawe it is written, By men of other tongues, and by other languages will I speake vnto this people: yet so shall they not heare me, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wherefore strange tongues are for a signe, not to them that beleeue, but to them that beleeue not: but prophecying serueth not for them that beleeue not, but for them which beleeue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If therefore when the whole Church is come together in one, and all speake strange tongues, there come in they that are vnlearned, or they which beleeue not, will they not say, that ye are out of your wittes?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But if all prophecie, and there come in one that beleeueth not, or one vnlearned, hee is rebuked of all men, and is iudged of all,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And so are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so he will fall downe on his face and worship God, and say plainely that God is in you in deede.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>What is to be done then, brethren? when ye come together, according as euery one of you hath a Psalme, or hath doctrine, or hath a tongue, or hath reuelation, or hath interpretation, let all things be done vnto edifying.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If any man speake a strange tongue, let it be by two, or at the most, by three, and that by course, and let one interprete.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if there be no interpreter, let him keepe silence in the Church, which speaketh languages, and let him speake to himselfe, and to God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Let the Prophets speake two, or three, and let the other iudge.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And if any thing be reueiled to another that sitteth by, let the first holde his peace.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For ye may all prophecie one by one, that all may learne, and all may haue comfort.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the spirits of the Prophets are subiect to the Prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as we see in all ye Churches of the Saints.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let your women keepe silence in the Churches: for it is not permitted vnto them to speake: but they ought to be subiect, as also the Lawe sayth.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And if they will learne any thing, let them aske their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speake in the Church.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Came the worde of God out from you? either came it vnto you onely?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>If any man thinke him selfe to be a Prophet, or spirituall, let him acknowledge, that the things, that I write vnto you, are the commandements of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Wherefore, brethren, couet to prophecie, and forbid not to speake languages.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Let all things be done honestly, and by order. </div><ul class='tnav'>
