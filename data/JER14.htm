Wee looked for peace, and there is no good, and for the time of health, and behold trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickednesse and the iniquitie of our fathers: for we haue sinned against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Doe not abhorre vs: for thy Names sake cast not downe the throne of thy glory: remember and breake not thy couenant with vs.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles, that can giue raine? or can the heauens giue showres? is it not thou, O Lord our God? therefore we will waite vpon thee: for thou hast made all these things. </div><ul class='tnav'>
