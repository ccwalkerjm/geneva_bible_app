My soule, prayse thou the Lord, and all that is within me, prayse his holy Name.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>My soule, prayse thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefites.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Which forgiueth all thine iniquitie, and healeth all thine infirmities.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Which redeemeth thy life from the graue, and crowneth thee with mercy and compassions.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Which satisfieth thy mouth with good things: and thy youth is renued like the eagles.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Lord executeth righteousnes and iudgement to all that are oppressed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He made his wayes knowen vnto Moses, and his workes vnto the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord is full of compassion and mercie, slowe to anger and of great kindnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He will not alway chide, neither keepe his anger for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He hath not dealt with vs after our sinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For as high as the heauen is aboue ye earth, so great is his mercie toward them that feare him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As farre as the East is from the West: so farre hath he remooued our sinnes from vs.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For he knoweth whereof we be made: he remembreth that we are but dust.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The dayes of man are as grasse: as a flowre of the fielde, so florisheth he.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For the winde goeth ouer it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall knowe it no more.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the louing kindnesse of the Lord endureth for euer and euer vpon them that feare him, and his righteousnes vpon childrens children,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Vnto them that keepe his couenant, and thinke vpon his commandements to doe them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Lord hath prepared his throne in heauen, and his Kingdome ruleth ouer all.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Prayse the Lord, ye his Angels, that excell in strength, that doe his commandement in obeying the voyce of his worde.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Prayse the Lord, all ye his hostes, ye his seruants that doe his pleasure.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Prayse the Lord, all ye his workes, in all places of his dominion: my soule, prayse thou the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
