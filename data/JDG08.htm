And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and tooke away the ornamentes, that were on their camels neckes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then the men of Israel sayd vnto Gideon, Reigne thou ouer vs, both thou, and thy sonne, and thy sonnes sonne: for thou hast deliuered vs out of the hand of Midian.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Gideon sayde vnto them, I will not reigne ouer you, neither shall my childe reigne ouer you, but the Lord shall reigne ouer you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Againe Gideon sayd vnto them, I would desire a request of you, that you would giue mee euery man the earings of his pray (for they had golden earings because they were Ismaelites)  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they answered, Wee will giue them. And they spred a garment, and did cast therein euery man the earings of his pray.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the weight of the golden earings that he required, was a thousande and seuen hundreth shekels of golde, beside collers and iewels, and purple rayment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the cheynes that were about their camels neckes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Gideon made an Ephod thereof, and put it in Ophrah his citie: and all Israel went a whoring there after it, which was the destruction of Gideon and his house.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thus was Midian brought lowe before the children of Israel, so that they lift vp their heads no more: and the countrey was in quietnes fourtie yeeres in the dayes of Gideon.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Ierubbaal the sonne of Ioash went, and dwelt in his owne house.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Gideon had seuentie sonnes begotten of his body: for he had many wiues.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And his concubine that was in Shechem, bare him a sonne also, whose name he called Abimelech.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Gideon the sonne of Ioash dyed in a good age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Ioash his father in Ophrah, of the father of ye Ezrites.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But when Gideon was dead, the children of Israel turned away and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their God.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the children of Israel remembred not the Lord their God, which had deliuered the out of the hands of all their enemies on euery side.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Neither shewed they mercy on the house of Ierubbaal, or Gideon, according to al the goodnesse which he had shewed vnto Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
