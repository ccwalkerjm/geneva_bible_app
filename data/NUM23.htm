Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last ende be like his.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Balak saide vnto Balaam, What hast thou done vnto mee? I tooke thee to curse mine enemies, and beholde, thou hast blessed them altogether.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he answered, and said, Must I not take heede to speake that, which the Lord hath put in my mouth?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Balak sayde vnto him, Come, I pray thee, with mee vnto another place, whence thou mayest see them, and thou shalt see but the vtmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: therefore curse them out of that place for my sake.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he brought him into Sede-sophim to the top of Pisgah, and built seuen altars, and offred a bullocke, and a ramme on euery altar.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>After, he sayde vnto Balak, Stande here by thy burnt offring, and I wil meete the Lord yonder.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord mette Balaam, and put an answere in his mouth, and sayd, Goe againe vnto Balak, and say thus.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when he came to him, beholde, hee stoode by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him: so Balak sayde vnto him, What hath the Lord sayd?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he vttered his parable, and sayde, Rise vp, Balak, and heare: hearken vnto me, thou sonne of Zippor.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God is not as man, that he should lie, neither as the sonne of man that he shoulde repent: hath he sayde and shall he not do it? and hath he spoken, and shall he not accomplish it?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, I haue receiued commandement to blesse: for he hath blessed, and I cannot alter it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Hee seeth none iniquitie in Iaakob, nor seeth no transgression in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the ioyfull shoute of a king is among them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>God brought them out of Egypt: their strength is as an vnicorne.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For there is no sorcerie in Iaakob, nor soothsaying in Israel: according to this time it shalbe sayde of Iaakob and of Israel, What hath God wrought?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Behold, the people shall rise vp as a lyon, and lift vp himselfe as a yong lyon: hee shall not lye downe, till he eate of the pray, and till he drinke the blood of the slayne.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Balak sayde vnto Balaam, Neither curse, nor blesse them at all.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But Balaam answered, and saide vnto Balak, Tolde not I thee, saying, All that the Lord speaketh, that must I do?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Againe Balak sayd vnto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I wil bring thee vnto another place, if so be it wil please God, that thou mayest thence curse them for my sake.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Balak brought Balaam vnto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Ieshmon.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Balaam sayde vnto Balak, Make me here seuen altars, and prepare me here seuen bullocks, and seuen rammes.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Balak did as Balaam had sayd, and offred a bullocke and a ram on euery altar. </div><ul class='tnav'>
