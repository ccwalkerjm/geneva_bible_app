As the one dyeth, so dyeth the other: for they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of man aboue ye beast: for all is vanitie.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All goe to one place, and all was of the dust, and all shall returne to the dust.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Who knoweth whether the spirit of man ascend vpward, and the spirit of the beast descend downeward to the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore I see that there is nothing better then that a man shoulde reioyce in his affaires, because that is his portion. For who shall bring him to see what shalbe after him? </div><ul class='tnav'>
