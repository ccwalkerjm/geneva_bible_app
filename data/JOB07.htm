O thou preseruer of me, why hast thou set me as a marke against thee, so that I am a burden vnto my selfe?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And why doest thou not pardon my trespasse? and take away mine iniquitie? for nowe shall I sleepe in the dust, and if thou seekest me in the morning, I shall not be found. </div><ul class='tnav'>
