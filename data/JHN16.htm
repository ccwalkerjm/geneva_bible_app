And these things said I not vnto you from ye beginning, because I was with you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But now I go my way to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But because I haue saide these thinges vnto you, your hearts are full of sorowe.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Yet I tell you the trueth, It is expedient for you that I goe away: for if I goe not away, that Comforter will not come vnto you: but if I depart, I will send him vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when he is come, he will reproue the worlde of sinne, and of righteousnesse, and of iudgement.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Of sinne, because they beleeued not in me:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Of righteousnesse, because I goe to my Father, and ye shall see me no more:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Of iudgement, because the prince of this world is iudged.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I haue yet many things to say vnto you, but ye cannot beare them nowe.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Howbeit, when he is come which is the Spirit of trueth, he will leade you into all trueth: for he shall not speake of himselfe, but whatsoeuer he shall heare, shall he speake, and he will shew you the things to come.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He shall glorifie me: for he shall receiue of mine, and shall shewe it vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All thinges that the Father hath, are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shewe it vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A litle while, and ye shall not see me: and againe a litle while, and ye shall see me: for I goe to the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then said some of his disciples among them selues, What is this that he saieth vnto vs, A litle while, and ye shall not see me, and againe, a litle while, and ye shall see me, and, For I goe to the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A litle while? we know not what he sayeth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now Iesus knew that they would aske him, and said vnto them, Doe ye enquire among your selues, of that I said, A litle while, and ye shall not see me: and againe, a litle while, and yee shall see me?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Verely, verely I say vnto you, that ye shall weepe and lament, and the worlde shall reioyce: and ye shall sorowe, but your sorowe shalbe turned to ioye.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A woman when she traueileth, hath sorowe, because her houre is come: but assoone as she is deliuered of the childe, she remembreth no more the anguish, for ioy that a man is borne into the world.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And ye nowe therefore are in sorowe: but I will see you againe, and your hearts shall reioyce, and your ioy shall no man take from you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And in that day shall ye aske me nothing. Verely, verely I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my Name, he will giue it you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Hitherto haue ye asked nothing in my Name: aske, and ye shall receiue, that your ioye may be full.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>These things haue I spoken vnto you in parables: but the time will come, when I shall no more speake to you in parables: but I shall shew you plainely of the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>At that day shall ye aske in my Name, and I say not vnto you, that I will pray vnto the Father for you:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For the Father himselfe loueth you, because ye haue loued me, and haue beleeued that I came out from God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I am come out from the Father, and came into the worlde: againe I leaue the worlde, and goe to the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>His disciples saide vnto him, Loe, nowe speakest thou plainely, and thou speakest no parable.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Nowe knowe wee that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should aske thee. By this we beleeue, that thou art come out from God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Iesus answered them, Doe you beleeue nowe?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Beholde, the houre commeth, and is already come, that ye shalbe scattered euery man into his owne, and shall leaue me alone: but I am not alone: for the Father is with me.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>These thinges haue I spoken vnto you, that in me ye might haue peace: in the world ye shall haue affliction, but be of good comfort: I haue ouercome the world. </div><ul class='tnav'>
