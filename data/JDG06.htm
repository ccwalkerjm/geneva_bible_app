And he sayde, I will tary vntill thou come againe.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then Gideon went in, and made ready a kidde, and vnleauened bread of an Ephah of floure, and put the flesh in a basket, and put the broth in a pot, and brought it out vnto him vnder the oke, and presented it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Angell of God saide vnto him, Take the flesh and the vnleauened bread, and lay them vpon this stone, and powre out the broth: and he did so.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the Angell of the Lord put forth the ende of the staffe that he had in his hand, and touched the flesh and the vnleauened bread: and there arose vp fire out of the stone, and consumed the flesh and the vnleauened bread: so the Angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when Gideon perceiued that it was an Angel of the Lord, Gideon then sayde, Alas, my Lord God: for because I haue seene an Angell of the Lord face to face, I shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord said vnto him, Peace be vnto thee: feare not, thou shalt not die.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Gideon made an altar there vnto the Lord, and called it, Iehouah shalom: vnto this day it is in Ophrah, of the father of the Ezrites.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the same night the Lord sayd vnto him, Take thy fathers yong bullocke, and an other bullocke of seuen yeeres olde, and destroy the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut downe the groue that is by it,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And build an altar vnto the Lord thy God vpon the top of this rocke, in a plaine place: and take the seconde bullocke, and offer a burnt offringe with the woode of the groue, which thou shalt cut downe.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Gideon tooke tenne men of his seruants, and did as ye Lord bade him: but because he feared to doe it by day for his fathers housholde, and the men of the citie, he did it by night.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when the men of the citie arose early in the morning, beholde, the altar of Baal was broken, and the groue cut downe that was by it, and the seconde bullocke offred vpon the altar that was made.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Therefore they saide one to another, Who hath done this thing? and when they inquired and asked, they saide, Gideon the sonne of Ioash hath done this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the men of the citie said vnto Ioash, Bring out thy sonne, that hee may dye: for he hath destroyed the altar of Baal, and hath also cut downe the groue that was by it.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Ioash said vnto all that stood by him, Will ye pleade Baals cause? or will ye saue him? he that will contend for him, let him dye or the morning. If he be God, let him pleade for himselfe against him that hath cast downe his altar.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And in that day was Gideon called Ierubbaal, that is, Let Baal pleade for himselfe because he hath broken downe his altar.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and they of ye East, were gathered together, aud went and pitched in the valley of Izreel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, and Abiezer was ioyned with him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he sent messengers thorowout al Manasseh, which also was ioyned with him, and he sent messengers vnto Asher, and to Zebulun and to Naphtali, and they came vp to meete them.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then Gideon said vnto God, If thou wilt saue Israel by mine hand, as thou hast sayd,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Beholde, I wil put a fleece of wooll in the threshing place: if the dewe come on the fleece onely, and it be drie vpon all the earth, then shall I be sure, that thou wilt saue Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And so it was: for he rose vp earely on the morow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, and filled a bowle of water.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Againe, Gideon sayde vnto God, Be not angry with me, that I may speake once more: let me prooue once againe, I pray thee, with the fleece: let it now be drie onely vpon the fleece, and let dewe be vpon all the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And God did so that same night: for it was drie vpon the fleece onely, and there was dewe on all the ground. </div><ul class='tnav'>
