 <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they shall answere, Because they forsooke the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the lande of Egypt, and haue taken holde on other gods, and haue worshipped them, and serued them, therefore hath he brought all this euill vpon them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
