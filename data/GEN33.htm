And he answered, They are ye childre whome God of his grace hath giuen thy seruant.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then came the maides neere, they, and their children, and bowed themselues.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Leah also with her children came neere and made obeysance: and after Ioseph and Rahel drew neere, and did reuerence.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he said, What meanest thou by all this droue, which I met? Who answered, I haue sent it, that I may finde fauour in the sight of my lorde:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Esau said, I haue ynough, my brother: keepe that thou hast to thy selfe.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But Iaakob answered, Nay, I pray thee: if I haue found grace nowe in thy sight, then receiue my present at mine hande: for I haue seene thy face, as though I had seene the face of God, because thou hast accepted me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I pray thee take my blessing, that is brought thee: for God hath had mercie on me, and therefore I haue all things: so he compelled him, and he tooke it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he saide, Let vs take our iourney and go, and I will goe before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then he answered him, My lord knoweth, that the children are tender, and the ewes and kine with yong vnder mine hande: and if they should ouerdriue them one day, all the flocke would die.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let now my lord go before his seruant, and I will driue softly, according to ye pase of ye cattel, which is before me, and as the children be able to endure, vntill I come to my lord vnto Seir.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Esau said, I will leaue then some of my folke with thee. And he answered, what needeth this? let me finde grace in the sight of my lorde.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Esau returned, and went his way that same day vnto Seir.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Iaakob went forwarde towarde Succoth, and built him an house, and made boothes for his cattell: therefore he called the name of the place Succoth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Afterward, Iaakob came safe to Sheche a citie, which is in the lande of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram, and pitched before the citie.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And there he bought a parcell of ground, where hee pitched his tent, at the hande of the sonnes of Hamor Shechems father, for an hundreth pieces of money.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he set vp there an altar, and called it, The mightie God of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
