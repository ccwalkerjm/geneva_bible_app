Why therefore doe I then labour to be more wise? And I sayd in mine heart, that this also is vanitie.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For there shalbe no remembrance of the wise, nor of the foole for euer: for that that now is, in the dayes to come shall all be forgotten. And howe dyeth the wise man, as doeth the foole?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore I hated life: for the worke that is wrought vnder the sunne is grieuous vnto me: for all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I hated also all my labour, wherein I had trauailed vnder the sunne, which I shall leaue to the man that shalbe after me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And who knoweth whether he shalbe wise or foolish? yet shall hee haue rule ouer all my labour, wherein I haue trauailed, and wherein I haue shewed my selfe wise vnder the sunne. This is also vanitie.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore I went about to make mine heart abhorre all the labour, wherein I had trauailed vnder the sunne.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For there is a man whose trauaile is in wisdome, and in knowledge and in equitie: yet to a man that hath not trauailed herein, shall he giue his portion: this also is vanitie and a great griefe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For what hath man of all his trauaile and griefe of his heart, wherein he hath trauailed vnder the sunne?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For all his dayes are sorowes, and his trauaile griefe: his heart also taketh not rest in the night: which also is vanitie.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There is no profit to man: but that he eate, and drinke, and delight his soule with the profit of his labour: I saw also this, that it was of the hand of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For who could eate, and who could haste to outward things more then I?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Surely to a man that is good in his sight, God giueth wisdome, and knowledge, and ioy: but to the sinner he giueth paine, to gather, and to heape to giue to him that is good before God: this is also vanitie, and vexation of the spirit. </div><ul class='tnav'>
