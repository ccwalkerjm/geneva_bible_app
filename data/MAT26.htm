He sayde vnto him, Thou hast sayd it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And as they did eate, Iesus tooke the bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gaue it to the disciples, and sayd, Take, eate: this is my bodie.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Also he tooke the cuppe, and when he had giuen thankes, he gaue it them, saying, Drinke ye all of it.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For this is my blood of the Newe Testament, that is shedde for many, for the remission of sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I say vnto you, that I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the vine vntil that day, when I shall drinke it new with you in my Fathers kingdome.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when they had sung a Psalme, they went out into the mount of Oliues.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then saide Iesus vnto them, All yee shall be offended by me this night: for it is written, I wil smite the shepheard, and the sheepe of the flocke shalbe scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But after I am risen againe, I will go before you into Galile.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But Peter aunswered, and sayde vnto him, Though that al men should be offended by thee, yet will I neuer be offended.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Iesus sayde vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, that this night, before the cocke crow, thou shalt denie me thrise.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Peter saide vnto him, Though I should die with thee, I will in no case denie thee. Likewise also sayd all the disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then went Iesus with them into a place which is called Gethsemane, and said vnto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I goe, and pray yonder.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And hee tooke vnto him Peter, and the two sonnes of Zebedeus, and began to waxe sorowfull, and grieuously troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then sayde Iesus vnto them, My soule is very heauie, euen vnto the death: tarie yee here, and watch with me.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>So hee went a litle further, and fell on his face, and praied, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup passe from me: neuerthelesse, not as I will, but as thou wilt.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>After, hee came vnto the disciples, and founde them a sleepe, and sayde to Peter, What? coulde yee not watch with me one houre?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Watch, and praie, that yee enter not into tentation: the spirit in deede is readie, but the flesh is weake.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Againe he went away the second time, and praied, saying, O my Father, if this cuppe can not passe away from mee, but that I must drinke it, thy will be done.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he came, and founde them a sleepe againe, for their eyes were heauie.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>So he left them and went away againe, and praied the third time, saying the same woordes.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then came he to his disciples, and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth, and take your rest: behold, the houre is at hand, and the Sonne of man is giuen into the hands of sinners.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Rise, let vs goe: beholde, hee is at hande that betraieth me.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And while hee yet spake, loe Iudas, one of the twelue, came, and with him a great multitude with swordes and staues, from the high Priests and Elders of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Now he that betraied him, had giuen them a token, saying, Whomesoeuer I shall kisse, that is he, laie holde on him.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And forthwith he came to Iesus, and sayd, God saue thee, Master, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then Iesus sayde vnto him, Friende, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laide hands on Iesus, and tooke him.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And behold, one of them which were with Iesus, stretched out his hand, and drewe his sworde, and strooke a seruaunt of the high Priest, and smote off his eare.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then sayde Iesus vnto him, Put vp thy sworde into his place: for all that take the sworde, shall perish with the sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Either thinkest thou, that I can not now pray to my Father, and he will giue me moe then twelue legions of Angels?  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Howe then shoulde the Scriptures bee fulfilled, which say, that it must be so?  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>The same houre sayde Iesus to the multitude, Ye be come out as it were against a thiefe, with swordes and staues to take mee: I sate daily teaching in the Temple among you, and yee tooke me not.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsooke him, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they tooke Iesus, and led him to Caiaphas the hie Priest, where the Scribes and the Elders were assembled.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And Peter followed him a farre off vnto the hie Priestes hall, and went in, and sate with the seruants to see the ende.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>Nowe the chiefe Priestes and the Elders, and all the whole councill sought false witnesse against Iesus, to put him to death.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>But they founde none, and though many false witnesses came, yet founde they none: but at the last came two false witnesses,  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And saide, This man saide, I can destroie the Temple of God, and build it in three daies.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Then the chiefe Priest arose, and sayde to him, Answerest thou nothing? What is the matter that these men witnesse against thee?  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>But Iesus helde his peace. Then the chiefe Priest answered, and saide to him, I charge thee sweare vnto vs by the liuing God, to tell vs, If thou be that Christ the Sonne of God, or no.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Iesus saide to him, Thou hast saide it: neuerthelesse I say vnto you, hereafter shall ye see the Sonne of man, sitting at the right hande of the power of God, and come in the cloudes of the heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then the hie Priest rent his clothes, saying, Hee hath blasphemed, what haue wee any more neede of witnesses? beholde: nowe yee haue heard his blasphemie.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>What thinke yee? They answered, and said, He is guiltie of death.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Then spet they in his face, and buffeted him, and other smote him with roddes,  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>Saying, Prophecie to vs, O Christ, Who is he that smote thee?  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>Peter sate without in the hall, and a maide came to him, saying, Thou also wast with Iesus of Galile:  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>But hee denied before them all, saying, I wote not what thou saiest.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>And when hee went out into the porche, another maide sawe him, and sayde vnto them that were there, This man was also with Iesus of Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>And againe he denied with an othe, saying, I knowe not the man.  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>So after a while, came vnto him they that stoode by, and sayde vnto Peter, Surely thou art also one of them: for euen thy speache bewraieth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>Then began hee to curse himselfe, and to sweare, saying, I knowe not the man. And immediately the cocke crewe.  <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>Then Peter remembred the wordes of Iesus, which had sayde vnto him, Before the cocke crowe thou shalt denie me thrise. So he went out, and wept bitterly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
