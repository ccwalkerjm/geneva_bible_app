Thus might we procure great euill against our soules.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And there was also a man that prophecied in the Name of the Lord, one Vriiah the sonne of Shemaiah, of Kiriath-iarem, who prophecied against this citie, and against this lande, according to all the wordes of Ieremiah.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Nowe when Iehoiakim the King with all his men of power, and all the princes heard his wordes, the King sought to slay him. But when Vriiah heard it, he was afraide and fled, and went into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Iehoiakim the King sent men into Egypt, euen Elnathan the sonne of Achbor, and certaine with him into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they fet Vriiah out of Egypt, and brought him vnto Iehoiakim the King, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead bodie into the graues of the children of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But the hande of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan was with Ieremiah that they shoulde not giue him into the hande of the people to put him to death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
