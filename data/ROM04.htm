Abraham beleeued God, and it was counted to him for righteousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Nowe to him that worketh, the wages is not counted by fauour, but by dette:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But to him that worketh not, but beleeueth in him that iustifieth the vngodly, his faith is counted for righteousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Euen as Dauid declareth the blessednesse of the man, vnto whom God imputeth righteousnes without workes, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Blessed are they, whose iniquities are forgiuen, and whose sinnes are couered.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Blessed is the man, to whom the Lord imputeth not sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Came this blessednesse then vpon the circumcision onely, or vpon the vncircumcision also? For we say, that faith was imputed vnto Abraham for righteousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Howe was it then imputed? when he was circumcised, or vncircumcised? not when he was cricumcised, but when he was vncircumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>After, he receiued the signe of circumcision, as the seale of the righteousnesse of ye faith which he had, when he was vncircumcised, that he should be the father of all them that beleeue, not being circumcised, that righteousnesse might be imputed to them also,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the father of circumcision, not vnto them onely which are of the circumcision, but vnto them also that walke in the steppes of the faith of our father Abraham, which he had when he was vncircumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For the promise that he should be the heire of the worlde, was not giuen to Abraham, or to his seede, through the Lawe, but through the righteousnesse of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For if they which are of the Lawe, be heires, faith is made voide, and the promise is made of none effect.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For the Lawe causeth wrath: for where no Lawe is, there is no transgression.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore it is by faith, that it might come by grace, and the promise might be sure to all the seede, not to that onely which is of the Lawe: but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of vs all,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>(As it is written, I haue made thee a father of many nations) euen before God whom he beleeued, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those thinges which be not, as though they were.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Which Abraham aboue hope, beleeued vnder hope, that he should be the father of many nations: according to that which was spoken to him, So shall thy seede be.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he not weake in the faith, considered not his owne bodie, which was nowe dead, being almost an hundreth yeere olde, neither the deadnes of Saraes wombe.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Neither did he doubt of the promise of God through vnbeliefe, but was strengthened in the faith, and gaue glorie to God,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Being fully assured that he which had promised, was also able to doe it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nowe it is not written for him onely, that it was imputed to him for righteousnesse,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But also for vs, to whom it shalbe imputed for righteousnesse, which beleeue in him that raised vp Iesus our Lord from the dead,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Who was deliuered to death for our sinnes, and is risen againe for our iustification. </div><ul class='tnav'>
