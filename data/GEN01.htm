So the euening and the morning were the first day.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Againe God said, Let there be a firmament in the mids of the waters: and let it separate the waters from the waters.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then God made the firmament, and separated the waters, which were vnder the firmament, from the waters which were aboue the firmament: and it was so.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And God called the firmament Heauen. So the Euening and the morning were the second day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>God said againe, Let the waters vnder the heauen be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appeare. and it was so.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And God called the dry land, Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters, Seas: and God saw that it was good.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then God said, Let the earth bud forth the bud of the herbe, that seedeth seed, the fruitfull tree, which beareth fruite according to his kinde, which hath his seede in it selfe vpon the earth: and it was so.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the earth brought foorth the bud of the herbe, that seedeth seede according to his kind, also the tree that beareth fruit, which hath his seed in it selfe according to his kinde: and God saw that it was good.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the euening and the morning were the third day.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heauen, to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signes, and for seasons, and for dayes and yeeres.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heauen to giue light vpon the earth: and it was so.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>God then made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesse light to rule the night: he made also the starres.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God set them in the firmament of the heauen, to shine vpon the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And to rule in the day, and in the night, and to separate the light from the darkenesse: and God saw that it was good.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So the euening and the morning were the fourth day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Afterward God said, Let the waters bring foorth in abundance euery creeping thing that hath life: and let the foule flie vpon the earth in the open firmament of the heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then God created the great whales, and euery thing liuing and mouing, which the waters brought foorth in abundance according to their kinde, and euery fethered foule according to his kinde: and God sawe that it was good.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then God blessed them, saying, Bring foorth fruite and multiplie, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the foule multiplie in the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So the euening and the morning were the fifte day.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Moreouer God said, Let the earth bring foorth the liuing thing according to his kinde, cattel, and that which creepeth, and the beast of the earth, according to his kinde. and it was so.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And God made the beast of the earth according to his kinde, and the cattell according to his kinde, and euery creeping thing of the earth according to his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Furthermore God said, Let vs make man in our image according to our likenes, and let them rule ouer the fish of the sea, and ouer the foule of the heauen, and ouer the beastes, and ouer all the earth, and ouer euery thing that creepeth and moueth on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thus God created the man in his image: in the image of God created he him: he created them male and female.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And God blessed them, and God said to them, Bring forth fruite and multiplie, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule ouer the fish of the sea, and ouer the foule of the heauen, and ouer euery beast that moueth vpon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And God said, Beholde, I haue giuen vnto you euery herbe bearing seede, which is vpon al the earth, and euery tree, wherein is the fruite of a tree bearing seede: that shall be to you for meate.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Likewise to euery beast of the earth, and to euery foule of the heauen, and to euery thing that moueth vpon the earth, which hath life in it selfe, euery greene herbe shall be for meate. and it was so.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And God sawe all that he had made, and loe, it was very good. So the euening and the morning were the sixt day. </div><ul class='tnav'>
