<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Saul consented to his death, and at that time, there was a great persecution against the Church which was at Hierusalem, and they were all scattered abroad thorowe the regions of Iudea and of Samaria, except the Apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then certaine men fearing God, caried Steuen amongs them, to be buried, and made great lamentation for him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But Saul made hauocke of the Church, and entred into euery house, and drewe out both men and women, and put them into prison.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went to and from preaching the worde.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then came Philip into the citie of Samaria, and preached Christ vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the people gaue heed vnto those things which Philippe spake, with one accorde, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For vncleane spirits crying with a loud voyce, came out of many that were possessed of them: and many taken with palsies, and that halted, were healed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there was great ioy in that citie.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And there was before in the citie a certaine man called Simon, which vsed witchcraft, and bewitched the people of Samaria, saying that he himselfe was some great man.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>To whome they gaue heede from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that great power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they gaue heed vnto him, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But assoone as they beleeued Philip, which preached the thinges that concerned the kingdome of God, and the Name of Iesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Simon himselfe beleeued also and was baptized, and continued with Philippe, and wondred, when he sawe the signes and great miracles which were done.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nowe when the Apostles, which were at Hierusalem, heard say, that Samaria had receiued the worde of God, they sent vnto them Peter and Iohn.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Which whe they were come downe, prayed for them, that they might receiue the holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>(For as yet, hee was fallen downe on none of them, but they were baptized onely in the Name of the Lord Iesus.)  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then layd they their handes on them, and they receiued the holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when Simon sawe, that through laying on of the Apostles hands the holy Ghost was giuen, he offred them money,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Saying, Giue mee also this power, that on whomsoeuer I lay the handes, he may receiue the holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then saide Peter vnto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou thinkest that the gift of God may be obteined with money.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou hast neither part nor fellowship in this businesse: for thine heart is not right in the sight of God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Repent therefore of this thy wickednes, and pray God, that if it be possible, the thought of thine heart may be forgiuen thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I see that thou art in the gall of bitternes, and in the bonde of iniquitie.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye haue spoken, come vpon me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So they, when they had testified and preached the worde of the Lord, returned to Hierusalem, and preached the Gospel in many townes of the Samaritans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the Angel of the Lord spake vnto Philip, saying, Arise, and goe towarde the South vnto the way that goeth downe from Hierusalem vnto Gaza, which is waste.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And hee arose and went on: and beholde, a certaine Eunuche of Ethiopia, Candaces the Queene of the Ethiopians chiefe Gouernour, who had the rule of all her treasure, and came to Hierusalem to worship:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And as he returned sitting in his charet, he read Esaias the Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then the Spirit said vnto Philip, Goe neere and ioyne thy selfe to yonder charet.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Philip ranne thither, and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias, and said, But vnderstandest thou what thou readest?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he saide, Howe can I, except I had a guide? And he desired Philip, that he would come vp and sit with him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Nowe the place of the Scripture which he read, was this, Hee was lead as a sheepe to the slaughter: and like a lambe domme before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>In his humilitie his iudgement hath bene exalted: but who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then the Eunuche answered Philippe, and saide, I pray thee of whome speaketh the Prophet this? of himselfe, or of some other man?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached vnto him Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as they went on their way, they came vnto a certaine water, and the Eunuche said, See, here is water: what doeth let me to be baptized?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Philippe said vnto him, If thou beleeuest with all thine heart, thou mayest. Then he answered, and saide, I beleeue that that Iesus Christ is that Sonne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then he commanded the charet to stand stil: and they went downe both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuche, and he baptized him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And assoone as they were come vp out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the Eunuche sawe him no more: so he went on his way reioycing.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But Philippe was found at Azotus, and he walked to and from preaching in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea. </div><ul class='tnav'>
