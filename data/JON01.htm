Arise, call vpon thy God, if so be that God wil thinke vpon vs, that we perish not.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they saide euery one to his fellowe, Come, and let vs cast lottes, that we may know, for whose cause this euill is vpon vs. So they cast lottes, and the lot fell vpon Ionah.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then said they vnto him, Tell vs for whose cause this euill is vpon vs? what is thine occupation? and whence commest thou? which is thy countrey? and of what people art thou?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he answered them, I am an Ebrewe, and I feare the Lord God of heauen, which hath made the sea, and the dry lande.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then were the men exceedingly afrayde, and said vnto him, Why hast thou done this? (for the men knewe, that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had tolde them)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then saide they vnto him, What shall we doe vnto thee, that the sea may be calme vnto vs? (for the sea wrought and was troublous)  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he said vnto them, Take me, and cast me into the sea: so shall the sea be calme vnto you: for I knowe that for my sake this great tempest is vpon you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, the men rowed to bring it to the lande, but they coulde not: for the sea wrought, and was troublous against them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wherefore they cryed vnto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee, let vs not perish for this mans life, and lay not vpon vs innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done, as it pleased thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So they tooke vp Ionah, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from her raging.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice vnto the Lord, and made vowes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Nowe the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallowe vp Ionah: and Ionah was in the belly of the fish three dayes, and three nightes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
