<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And hee called his twelue disciples vnto him, and gaue them power against vncleane spirits, to cast them out, and to heale euery sickenesse, and euery disease.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Nowe the names of the twelue Apostles are these. The first is Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother: Iames the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iohn his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Philippe and Bartlemewe: Thomas, and Matthewe that Publicane: Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Lebbeus whose surname was Thaddeus:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Simon the Cananite, and Iudas Iscariot, who also betraied him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>These twelue did Iesus send forth, and commanded them, saying, Goe not into the way of of the Gentiles, and into the cities of the Samaritans enter yee not:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But goe rather to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And as ye goe, preach, saying, The kingdome of heauen is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Heale the sicke: cleanse the lepers: raise vp the dead: cast out the deuils. Freely ye haue receiued, freely giue.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Possesse not golde, nor siluer, nor money in your girdels,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Nor a scrippe for the iourney, neither two coates, neither shoes, nor a staffe: for the workeman is worthie of his meate.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And into whatsoeuer citie or towne ye shall come, enquire who is worthy in it, and there abide till yee goe thence.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when yee come into an house, salute the same.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if the house be worthy, let your peace come vpon it: but if it be not worthie, let your peace returne to you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And whosoeuer shall not receiue you, nor heare your woordes, when yee depart out of that house, or that citie, shake off the dust of your feete.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Truely I say vnto you, it shall be easier for them of the lande of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of iudgement, then for that citie.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Behold, I send you as sheepe in the middes of the wolues: be yee therefore wise as serpents, and innocent as doues.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But beware of men, for they will deliuer you vp to the Councils, and will scourge you in their Synagogues.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And ye shall be brought to the gouernours and Kings for my sake, in witnes to them, and to the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But when they deliuer you vp, take no thought howe or what ye shall speake: for it shall be giuen you in that houre, what ye shall say.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For it is not yee that speake, but the spirite of your father which speaketh in you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the sonne, and the children shall rise against their parents, and shall cause them to die.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And yee shall be hated of all men for my Name: but he that endureth to the end, he shall be saued.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when they persecute you in this citie, flee into another: for verely I say vnto you, yee shall not goe ouer all the cities of Israel, till the Sonne of man be come.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The disciple is not aboue his master, nor the seruant aboue his Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>It is ynough for the disciple to bee as his master is, and the seruaunt as his Lord. If they haue called the master of the house Beel-zebub, howe much more them of his housholde?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Feare them not therefore: for there is nothing couered, that shall not be disclosed, nor hid, that shall not be knowen.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>What I tell you in darkenesse, that speake yee in light: and what yee heare in the eare, that preach yee on the houses.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And feare yee not them which kill the bodie, but are nor able to kill the soule: but rather feare him, which is able to destroy both soule and bodie in hell.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Are not two sparrowes sold for a farthing, and one of them shall not fal on the ground without your Father?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Yea, and all the heares of your head are nombred.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Feare ye not therefore, yee are of more value then many sparowes.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Whosoeuer therefore shall confesse me before men, him will I confesse also before my Father which is in heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But whosoeuer shall denie me before me, him will I also denie before my Father which is in heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Thinke not that I am come to sende peace into the earth: I came not to send peace, but the sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And a mans enemies shall be they of his owne housholde.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He that loueth father or mother more then me, is not worthie of me. And he that loueth sonne, or daughter more then mee, is not worthie of me.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And hee that taketh not his crosse, and followeth after me, is not worthie of me.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>He that will finde his life, shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall finde it.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He that receiueth you, receiueth me: and hee that receiueth mee, receiueth him that hath sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Hee that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receiue a Prophetes rewarde: and hee that receiueth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receiue the rewarde of a righteous man.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And whosoeuer shall giue vnto one of these litle ones to drinke a cuppe of colde water onely, in the name of a disciple, verely I say vnto you, he shall not lose his rewarde. </div><ul class='tnav'>
