And the woman answered them, They be gone ouer the brooke of water. And when they had sought them, and could not finde them, they returned to Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And assoone as they were departed, the other came out of the well, and went and tolde King Dauid, and sayde vnto him, Vp, and get you quickely ouer the water: for such counsell hath Ahithophel giuen against you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Dauid arose, and all the people that were with him, and they went ouer Iorden vntil the dawning of the day, so that there lacked not one of them, that was not come ouer Iorden.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nowe when Ahithophel sawe that his counsell was not followed, he sadled his asse, and arose, and he went home vnto his citie, and put his houshold in order, and hanged him selfe, and dyed, and was buryed in his fathers graue.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Dauid came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed ouer Iorden, he, and all the men of Israel with him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Absalom made Amasa captaine of the hoste in the stead of Ioab: which Amasa was a mans sonne named Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Ioabs mother.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when Dauid was come to Mahanaim, Shobi the sonne of Nahash out of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the sonne of Ammiel out of Lo-debar, and Barzelai the Gileadite out of Rogel  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Brought beds, and basens, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and floure, and parched corne, and beanes, and lentiles, and parched corne.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they brought hony, and butter, and sheepe, and cheese of kine for Dauid and for the people that were with him, to eate: for they said, The people is hungry, and wearie, and thirstie in the wildernesse. </div><ul class='tnav'>
