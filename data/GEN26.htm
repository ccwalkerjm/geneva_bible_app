Wherefore Izhak went to Abimelech King of the Philistims vnto Gerar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For the Lord appeared vnto him, and sayde, Goe not downe into Egypt, but abide in the land which I shall shewe vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Dwell in this lande, and I will be with thee, and will blesse thee: for to thee, and to thy seede I will giue all these countreys: and I will performe the othe which I sware vnto Abraham thy father.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Also I wil cause thy seede to multiply as the starres of heauen, and will giue vnto thy seede all these countreys: and in thy seede shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Because that Abraham obeyed my voyce and kept mine ordinance, my commandements, my statutes, and my Lawes.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Izhak dwelt in Gerar.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the men of the place asked him of his wife, and he sayd, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife, least, sayde he, the men of the place shoulde kill me, because of Rebekah: for she was beautifull to the eye.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So after hee had bene there long time, Abimelech King of the Philistims looked out at a windowe, and loe, he sawe Izhak sporting with Rebekah his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Abimelech called Izhak, and sayde, Loe, shee is of a suertie thy wife, and why saydest thou, She is my sister? To whom Izhak answered, Because I thought this, It may be that I shall dye for her.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Abimelech said, Why hast thou done this vnto vs? one of the people had almost lien by thy wife, so shouldest thou haue brought sinne vpon vs.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man, or his wife, shall die the death.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Afterwarde Izhak sowed in that lande, and founde in the same yeere an hundreth folde by estimation: and so the Lord blessed him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the man waxed mightie, and stil increased, till he was exceeding great,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For he had flockes of sheepe, and heards of cattell, and a mightie housholde: therefore the Philistims had enuy at him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>In so much that the Philistims stopped and filled vp with earth all the welles, which his fathers seruantes digged in his father Abrahams time.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Abimelech sayde vnto Izhak, Get thee from vs, for thou art mightier then wee a great deale.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore Izhak departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Izhak returning, digged the welles of water, which they had digged in the dayes of Abraham his father: for the Philistims had stopped them after the death of Abraham, and hee gaue them the same names, which his father gaue them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Izhaks seruantes then digged in the valley, and found there a well of liuing water.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the herdmen of Gerar did striue with Izhaks herdmen, saying, The water is ours: therefore called he the name of the well Esek, because they were at strife with him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Afterwarde they digged another well, and stroue for that also, and he called the name of it Sitnah.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then he remoued thence, and digged an other well, for the which they stroue not: therefore called hee the name of it Rehoboth, and sayde, Because the Lord hath nowe made vs roome, we shall increase vpon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So he went vp thence to Beer-sheba.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the Lord appeared vnto him the same night, and sayde, I am the God of Abraham thy father: feare not, for I am with thee, and wil blesse thee, and will multiplie thy seede for my seruant Abrahams sake.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then he builte an altar there, and called vpon the Name of the Lord, and there spred his tent: where also Izhaks seruauntes digged a well.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then came Abimelech to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friendes, and Phichol the captaine of his armie.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>To whom Izhak sayd, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate mee and haue put mee away from you?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Who answered, Wee sawe certainely that the Lord was with thee, and wee thought thus, Let there be nowe an othe betweene vs, euen betweene vs and thee, and let vs make a couenant with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If thou shalt do vs no hurt, as we haue not touched thee, and as we haue done vnto thee nothing but good, and sent thee away in peace: thou nowe, the blessed of the Lord, doe this.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then hee made them a feast, and they dyd eate and drinke.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they rose vp betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: then Izhak let them go, and they departed from him in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And that same day Izhaks seruantes came and tolde him of a well, which they had digged, and said vnto him, We haue found water.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So hee called it Shibah: therefore the name of the citie is called Beer-sheba vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Nowe when Esau was fourtie yeere olde, he tooke to wife Iudith, the daughter of Beeri an Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon an Hittite also.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they were a griefe of minde to Izhak and to Rebekah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
