Tary for me seuen dayes, till I come to thee and shewe thee what thou shalt doe.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when he had turned his backe to goe from Samuel, God gaue him another heart: and all those tokens came to passe that same day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And when they came thither to the hill, beholde, the companie of Prophets meete him, and the Spirit of God came vpon him, and he prophecied among them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore all the people that knewe him before, when they saw that he prophecied among the Prophets, saide eche to other, What is come vnto the sonne of Kish? is Saul also among the Prophets?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And one of the same place answered, and said, But who is their father? Therefore it was a prouerbe, Is Saul also among the Prophets?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when he had made an ende of prophecying, he came to the hie place.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Sauls vncle saide vnto him, and to his seruant, Whither went ye? And he saide, To seeke the asses: and when we sawe that they were no where, we came to Samuel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Sauls vncle saide, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Saul saide to his vncle, He tolde vs plainely that the asses were founde: but concerning the kingdome whereof Samuel spake, tolde he him not.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Samuel assembled the people vnto the Lord in Mizpeh,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he saide vnto the children of Israel, Thus saith ye Lord God of Israel, I haue brought Israel out of Egypt, and deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the handes of all kingdomes that troubled you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But ye haue this day cast away your God, who onely deliuereth you out of all your aduersities and tribulations: and ye said vnto him, No, but appoint a King ouer vs. Nowe therefore stand ye before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your thousands.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when Samuel had gathered together all the tribes of Israel, the tribe of Beniamin was taken.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Afterwarde he assembled the tribe of Beniamin according to their families, and the familie of Matri was taken. So Saul the sonne of Kish was taken, and when they sought him, he coulde not be found.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore they asked the Lord againe, if that man should yet come thither. And the Lord answered, Beholde, he hath hid himselfe among the stuffe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they ranne, and brought him thence: and when he stoode among the people, he was hier then any of the people from the shoulders vpwarde.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Samuel saide to all the people, See ye not him, whom the Lord hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? and all the people shouted and saide, God saue the King.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Samuel tolde the people the duetie of the kingdome, and wrote it in a booke, and laied it vp before the Lord, and Samuel sent all the people away euery man to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Saul also went home to Gibeah, and there followed him a bande of men, whose heart God had touched,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But the wicked men saide, Howe shall hee saue vs? So they despised him, and brought him no presents: but he held his tongue. </div><ul class='tnav'>
