<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 40</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In the first day of the first moneth in the very first of the same moneth shalt thou set vp the Tabernacle, called ye Tabernacle of the Congregation:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And thou shalt put therein the Arke of the Testimonie, and couer the Arke with the vaile.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Also thou shalt bring in the Table, and set it in order as it doth require: thou shalt also bring in the Candlesticke, and light his lampes,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And thou shalt set ye incense Altar of gold before the Arke of the Testimonie, and put the hanging at the doore of the Tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moreouer, thou shalt set the burnt offering Altar before the doore of the Tabernacle, called the Tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thou shalt set the Lauer betweene the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, and put water therein.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then thou shalt appoynt the courte round about, and hang vp the hanging at the courte gate.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>After, thou shalt take the anoynting oyle, and anoynt the Tabernacle, and all that is therein, and halowe it with all the instruments thereof, that it may be holy.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And thou shalt anoynt the Altar of the burnt offring, and all his instruments, and shalt sanctifie the Altar, that it may bee an altar most holie.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Also thou shalt anoynt the Lauer, and his foote, and shalt sanctifie it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then thou shalt bring Aaron and his sonnes vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and wash them with water.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt put vpon Aaron the holy garmentes, and shalt anoynt him, and sanctifie him, that he may minister vnto me in the Priestes office.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou shalt also bring his sonnes, and clothe them with garments,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And shalt anoynt them as thou diddest anoynt their father, that they may minister vnto mee in the Priestes office: for their anoynting shall be a signe, that the Priesthood shall be euerlasting vnto them throughout their generations.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Moses did according to all that ye Lord had commanded him: so did he.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus was the Tabernacle reared vp the first day of the first moneth in the seconde yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Moses reared vp the Tabernacle and fastened his sockets, and set vp the boardes thereof, and put in the barres of it, and reared vp his pillars.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he spred the couering ouer the Tabernacle, and put the couering of that couering on hie aboue it, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he tooke and put the Testimonie in the Arke, and put the barres in the ringes of the Arke, and set the Merciseate on hie vpon the Arke.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He brought also the Arke into the Tabernacle, and hanged vp the couering vaile, and couered the Arke of the Testimonie, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Furthermore he put the Table in the Tabernacle of the Congregation in the Northside of the Tabernacle, without the vaile,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And set the bread in order before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Also he put the Candlesticke in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, ouer against the Table toward ye Southside of the Tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he lighted the lampes before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Moreouer he set the golden Altar in the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the vayle,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And burnt sweete incense thereon, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Also he hanged vp the vayle at the doore of the Tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>After, he set the burnt offring Altar without the doore of the Tabernacle, called the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and offered the burnt offering and the sacrifice thereon, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Likewise he set the Lauer betweene the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, and powred water therein to wash with.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So Moses and Aaron, and his sonnes washed their handes and their feete thereat.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>When they went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and when they approched to the Altar, they washed, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Finally, he reared vp the court rounde about the Tabernacle and the Altar, and hanged vp the vaile at the court gate: so Moses finished the worke.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then the cloud couered the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the glorie of the Lord filled the Tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So Moses could not enter into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, because the cloude abode thereon, and the glorie of the Lord filled the Tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Nowe when the cloude ascended vp from the Tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward in all their iourneyes.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But if the cloude ascended not, then they iourneyed not till the day that it ascended.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For the cloude of the Lord was vpon the Tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their iourneyes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
