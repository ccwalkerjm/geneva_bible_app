 <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For they saide not, Where is the Lord that brought vs vp out of the lande of Egypt? that led vs through the wildernesse, through a desert, and waste land, through a drie land, and by the shadow of death, by a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I brought you into a plentifull countrey, to eat the fruit thereof, and the commodities of the same: but when yee entred, yee defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that should minister the Lawe, knewe me not: the pastours also offended against me, and the Prophets prophesied in Baal, and went after things that did not profite.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Wherefore I wil yet plead with you, saith the Lord, and I will pleade with your childrens children.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For goe ye to the yles of Chittim, and beholde, and sende vnto Kedar. and take diligent heede, and see whether there be such things.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hath any nation changed their gods, which yet are no gods? but my people haue chaged their glorie, for that which doeth not profite.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>O yee heauens, be astonied at this: bee afraid and vtterly confounded, sayeth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For my people haue committed two euils: they haue forsaken mee the fountaine of liuing waters, to digge them pittes, euen broken pittes, that can holde no water.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Is Israel a seruaunt, or is hee borne in the house? why then is he spoiled?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The lions roared vpon him and yelled, and they haue made his land waste: his cities are burnt without an inhabitant.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes haue broken thine head.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Hast not thou procured this vnto thy selfe, because thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And what hast thou now to do in the way of Egypt? to drinke the water of Nilus? or what makest thou in the way of Asshur? to drinke the water of the Riuer?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thine owne wickednes shall correct thee, and thy turnings backe shall reprooue thee: know therefore and beholde, that it is an euil thing, and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my feare is not in thee, sayeth the Lord God of hostes.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For of olde time I haue broken thy yoke, and burst thy bondes, and thou saidest, I will no more transgresse, but like an harlot thou runnest about vpon al hie hilles, and vnder all greene trees.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Yet I had planted thee, a noble vine, whose plants were all natural: howe then art thou turned vnto me into the plants of a strange vine?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope, yet thine iniquitie is marked before me, sayeth the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Howe canst thou say, I am not polluted, neither haue I followed Baalim? beholde thy waies in the valley, and know, what thou hast done: thou art like a swift dromedarie, that runneth by his waies.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And as a wilde asse, vsed to the wildernesse, that snuffeth vp the winde by occasion at her pleasure: who can turne her backe? all they that seeke her, will not wearie themselues, but wil finde her in her moneth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Keepe thou thy feete from barenes, and thy throte from thirst: but thou saidest desperately, No, for I haue loued strangers, and them will I follow.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>As the theefe is ashamed, when he is foud, so is the house of Israel ashamed, they, their kings, their princes and their Priests, and their Prophets,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Saying to a tree, Thou art my father, and to a stone, Thou hast begotten me: for they haue turned their back vnto me, and not their face: but in ye time of their troble they wil say, Arise, and help vs.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But where are thy gods, that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can helpe thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the nomber of thy cities, are thy gods, O Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Wherefore wil ye pleade with me? ye all haue rebelled against me, sayeth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I haue smitten your children in vaine, they receiued no correction: your owne sworde hath deuoured your Prophets like a destroying lyon.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>O generation, take heede to the worde of the Lord: haue I bene as a wildernesse vnto Israel? or a lande of darkenesse? Wherefore sayeth my people then, We are lordes, we will come no more vnto thee?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Can a maid forget her ornament, or a bride her attire? yet my people haue forgotten me, daies without number.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Why doest thou prepare thy way, to seeke amitie? euen therefore will I teach thee, that thy waies are wickednesse.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Also in thy wings is founde the bloud of the soules of ye poore innocents: I haue not found it in holes, but vpon all these places.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Yet thou saiest, Because I am giltles, surely his wrath shall turne from mee: beholde, I will enter with thee into iudgement, because thou saiest, I haue not sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Why runnest thou about so much to change thy waies? for thou shalt be confounded of Egypt, as thou art confounded of Asshur.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For thou shalt goe foorth from thence, and thine hands vpon thine head, because the Lord hath reiected thy confidence, and thou shalt not prosper thereby. </div><ul class='tnav'>
