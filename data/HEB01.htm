Wherefore God, eue thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyle of gladnes aboue thy fellowes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast established the earth, and the heauens are the workes of thine handes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They shall perish, but thou doest remaine: and they all shall waxe olde as doeth a garment.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And as a vesture shalt thou folde them vp, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy yeeres shall not faile.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Vnto which also of the Angels saide he at any time, Sit at my right hand, til I make thine enemies thy footestoole?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Are they not al ministring spirits, sent forth to minister, for their sakes which shalbe heires of saluation? </div><ul class='tnav'>
