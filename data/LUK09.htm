Then he tooke them to him, and went aside into a solitarie place, neere to the citie called Bethsaida.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But when the people knewe it, they followed him: and he receiued them, and spake vnto them of the kingdome of God, and healed them that had neede to be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when the day began to weare away, the twelue came, and sayd vnto him, Sende the people away, that they may goe into the townes and villages round about, and lodge, and get meate: for we are here in a desart place.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But he sayd vnto them, Giue ye them to eate. And they sayd, We haue no more but fiue loaues and two fishes, except we should go and buy meate for all this people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For they were about fiue thousand men. Then he sayde to his disciples, Cause them to sit downe by fifties in a company.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they did so, and caused all to sit downe.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then he tooke the fiue loaues, and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen, and blessed them, and brake, and gaue to the disciples, to set before the people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So they did all eate, and were satisfied: and there was taken vp of that remained to them, twelue baskets full of broken meate.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it came to passe, as hee was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They answered, and sayd, Iohn Baptist: and others say, Elias: and some say, that one of the olde Prophets is risen againe.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he sayd vnto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answered, and sayd, That Christ of God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he warned and commanded them, that they should tell that to no man,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Saying, The Sonne of man must suffer many things and be reproued of the Elders, and of the hie Priests and Scribes, and be slaine, and the third day rise againe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he sayd to them all, If any man will come after me, let him denie himselfe, and take vp his crosse dayly, and follow me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: and whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall saue it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For what auantageth it a man, if he win the whole worlde, and destroy himselfe, or lose himselfe?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For whosoeuer shall be ashamed of me, and of my wordes, of him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed, when hee shall come in his glorie, and in the glorie of the Father, and of the holy Angels.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I tell you of a suretie, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they haue seene the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it came to passe about an eyght dayes after those wordes, that he tooke Peter and Iohn, and Iames, and went vp into a mountaine to pray.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was changed, and his garment was white and glistered.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And beholde, two men talked with him, which were Moses and Elias:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Which appeared in glory, and tolde of his departing, which he shoulde accomplish at Hierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But Peter and they that were with him, were heauie with sleepe, and when they awoke, they saw his glorie, and the two men standing with him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it came to passe, as they departed from him, Peter said vnto Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here: let vs therefore make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias, and wist not what he said.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Whiles he thus spake, there came a cloude and ouershadowed them, and they feared when they were entring into the cloude.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And there came a voyce out of the cloud, saying, This is that my beloued Sonne, heare him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when the voyce was past, Iesus was found alone: and they kept it close, and tolde no man in those dayes any of those things which they had seene.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And it came to passe on the next day, as they came downe from the mountaine, much people met him.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And beholde, a man of the companie cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, beholde my sonne: for he is all that I haue.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And loe, a spirit taketh him, and suddenly he crieth, and he teareth him, that he fometh, and hardly departeth from him, when he hath bruised him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Nowe I haue besought thy disciples to cast him out, but they could not.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then Iesus answered, and said, O generation faithlesse, and crooked, howe long now shall I be with you, and suffer you? bring thy sonne hither.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And whiles he was yet comming, the deuill rent him, and tare him: and Iesus rebuked the vncleane spirite, and healed the childe, and deliuered him to his father.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And they were all amased at the mightie power of God: and while they all wondered at al things, which Iesus did, he said vnto his disciples,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Marke these wordes diligently: for it shall come to passe, that the Sonne of man shalbe deliuered into the handes of men.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But they vnderstood not that word: for it was hid from them, so that they could not perceiue it: and they feared to aske him of that worde.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then there arose a disputation among them, which of them should be the greatest.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>When Iesus sawe the thoughtes of their heartes, he tooke a litle childe, and set him by him,  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And said vnto them, Whosoeuer receiueth this litle childe in my Name, receiueth me: and whosoeuer shall receiue me, receiueth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, he shall be great.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And Iohn answered and saide, Master, we sawe one casting out deuils in thy Name, and we forbad him, because he followeth thee not with vs.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then Iesus saide vnto him, Forbid ye him not: for he that is not against vs, is with vs.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And it came to passe, when the dayes were accomplished, that he should be receiued vp, he setled himselfe fully to goe to Hierusalem,  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And sent messengers before him: and they went and entred into a towne of the Samaritans, to prepare him lodging.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>But they woulde not receiue him, because his behauiour was, as though he would go to Hierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And when his disciples, Iames and Iohn sawe it, they saide, Lord, wilt thou that we commaund, that fire come downe from heauen, and consume them, euen as Elias did?  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>But Iesus turned about, and rebuked them, and said, Ye knowe not of what spirit ye are.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>For the Sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them. Then they went to another towne.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And it came to passe that as they went in the way, a certaine man said vnto him, I will follow thee, Lord, whithersoeuer thou goest.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And Iesus saide vnto him, The foxes haue holes, and the birdes of the heauen nestes, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>But he said vnto another, Followe me. And the same said, Lord, suffer me first to goe and burie my father.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And Iesus said vnto him, Let the dead burie their dead: but go thou, and preache the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Then another saide, I will follow thee, Lord: but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at mine house.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And Iesus saide vnto him, No man that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh backe, is apt to the kingdome of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
