<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 25</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then the kingdome of heauen shalbe likened vnto tenne virgins, which tooke their lampes, and went foorth to meete the bridegrome.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And fiue of them were wise, and fiue foolish.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The foolish tooke their lampes, but tooke none oyle with them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But the wise tooke oyle in their vessels with their lampes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Nowe while the bridegrome taried long, all slumbred and slept.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And at midnight there was a crie made, Behold, the bridegrome commeth: goe out to meete him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lampes.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the foolish said to the wise, Giue vs of your oyle, for our lampes are out.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But the wise answered, saying, Not so, lest there will not be ynough for vs and you: but goe ye rather to them that sell, and bye for your selues.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And while they went to bye, the bridegrome came: and they that were readie, went in with him to the wedding, and the gate was shut.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But he answered, and said, Verely I say vnto you, I knowe you not.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Watch therfore: for ye know neither the day, nor the houre, when the sonne of man will come.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the kingdome of heauen is as a man that going into a strange countrey, called his seruants, and deliuered to them his goods.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And vnto one he gaue fiue talents, and to an other two, and to another one, to euery man after his own ability, and straightway went from home.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then he that had receiued the fiue talents, went and occupied with them, and gained other fiue talents.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Likewise also, he that receiued two, he also gained other two.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But he that receiued that one, went and digged it in the earth, and hid his masters money.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But after a long season, the master of those seruants came, and reckoned with them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then came he that had receiued fiue talents, and brought other fiue talents, saying, Master, thou deliueredst vnto me fiue talents: behold, I haue gained with them other fiue talents.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then his master saide vnto him, It is well done good seruant and faithfull, Thou hast bene faithfull in litle, I will make thee ruler ouer much: enter into thy masters ioy.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Also he that had receiued two talents, came, and said, Master, thou deliueredst vnto me two talents: behold, I haue gained two other talets more.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>His master saide vnto him, It is well done good seruant, and faithfull, Thou hast bene faithfull in litle, I will make thee ruler ouer much: enter into thy masters ioy.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then he which had receiued the one talent, came, and said, Master, I knewe that thou wast an hard man, which reapest where thou sowedst not, and gatherest where thou strawedst not:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I was therefore afraide, and went, and hid thy talent in the earth: behold, thou hast thine owne.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And his master answered, and said vnto him, Thou euill seruant, and slouthfull, thou knewest that I reape where I sowed not, and gather where I strawed not.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thou oughtest therefore to haue put my money to ye exchangers, and then at my comming should I haue receiued mine owne with vantage.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Take therefore the talent from him, and giue it vnto him which hath tenne talents.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For vnto euery man that hath, it shall be giuen, and he shall haue abundance, and from him that hath not, euen that he hath, shalbe taken away.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Cast therefore that vnprofitable seruant into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnasshing of teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when the Sonne of man commeth in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall he sit vpon the throne of his glorie,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And before him shalbe gathered all nations, and he shall seperate them one from another, as a shepheard separateth the sheepe from ye goates.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he shall set the sheepe on his right hand, and the goates on the left.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then shall ye king say to them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my father: take the inheritance of the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me drinke: I was a stranger, and ye tooke me in vnto you.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>I was naked, and ye clothed me: I was sicke, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then shall the righteous answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or a thirst, and gaue thee drinke?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And when sawe we thee a stranger, and tooke thee in vnto vs? or naked, and clothed thee?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Or when sawe we thee sicke, or in prison, and came vnto thee?  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And the King shall answere, and say vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, in as much as ye haue done it vnto one of the least of these my brethre, ye haue done it to me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then shall he say vnto them on ye left hand, Depart from me ye cursed, into euerlasting fire, which is prepared for the deuill and his angels.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me no meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me no drinke:  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>I was a stranger, and ye tooke me not in vnto you: I was naked, and ye clothed me not: sicke, and in prison, and ye visited me not.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then shall they also answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an hungred, or a thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sicke, or in prison, and did not minister vnto thee?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then shall he answere them, and say, Verely I say vnto you, in as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And these shall goe into euerlasting paine, and the righteous into life eternall. </div><ul class='tnav'>
