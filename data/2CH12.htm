And also in Iudah the things prospered.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So King Rehoboam was strong in Ierusalem and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and fourtie yere olde, when he began to reigne, and reigned seuenteene yeres in Ierusalem, the citie which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his Name there. And his mothers name was Naamah an Ammonitesse.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he did euill: for hee prepared not his heart to seeke the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The actes also of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the booke of Shemaiah the Prophet, and Iddo the Seer, in rehearsing the genealogie? and there was warre alway betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid, and Abiiah his sonne reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
