I the Lord am the first, and with the last I am ye same.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The yles sawe it, and did feare, and the ends of the earth were abashed, drew neere, and came.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Euery man helped his neighbour, and saide to his brother, Be strong.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So the workeman comforted the founder, and he that smote with ye hammer, him that smote by course, saying, It is ready for the sodering, and he fastened it with nayles that it shoulde not be mooued.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But thou, Israel, art my seruant, and thou Iaakob, whom I haue chosen, the seede of Abraham my friend.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For I haue taken thee from the endes of the earth, and called thee before the chiefe thereof, and saide vnto thee, Thou art my seruant: I haue chosen thee, and not cast thee away.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Feare thou not, for I am with thee: be not afraide, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, and helpe thee, and will susteine thee with the right hand of my iustice.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Beholde, all they that prouoke thee, shalbe ashamed, and confounded: they shalbe as nothing, and they that striue with thee, shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou shalt seeke them and shalt not finde them: to wit, the men of thy strife, for they shall be as nothing, and the men that warre against thee, as a thing of nought.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying vnto thee, Feare not, I wil helpe thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Feare not, thou worme, Iaakob, and ye men of Israel: I wil helpe thee, sayth the Lord and thy redeemer the holy one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, I wil make thee a roller, and a newe threshing instrument hauing teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountaines, and bring them to pouder, and shalt make the hilles as chaffe.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou shalt fanne them, and the winde shall carie them away, and the whirlewinde shall scatter them: and thou shalt reioyce in the Lord, and shalt glory in the holy one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When the poore and the needy seeke water, and there is none (their tongue faileth for thirst: I the Lord will heare them: I the God of Israel will not forsake them)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I will open riuers in the toppes of the hils, and fountaines in the middes of the valleis: I will make the wildernesse as a poole of water, and the waste land as springs of water.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I will set in the wildernesse the cedar, the shittah tree, and the mirre tree, and the pine tree, and I will set in the wildernesse the firre tree, the elme and the boxe tree together.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore let them see and knowe, and let them consider and vnderstande together that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the holy one of Israel hath created it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Stand to your cause, saith the Lord: bring forth your strong reasons, saith ye King of Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let them bring foorth, and let them tell vs what shall come: let them shew the former things what they be, that wee may consider them, and knowe the latter ende of them: either declare vs things for to come.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Shewe the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yea, doe good or doe euill, that we may declare it, and beholde it together.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Beholde, ye are of no value, and your making is of naught: man hath chosen an abomination by them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I haue raised vp from the North, and he shall come: from the East sunne shall he cal vpon my Name, and shall come vpon princes as vpon clay, and as the potter treadeth myre vnder the foote.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may knowe? or before time, that we may say, He is righteous? Surely there is none that sheweth: surely there is none that declareth: surely there is none that heareth your wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I am the first, that saieth to Zion, Beholde, beholde them: and I will giue to Ierusalem one that shall bring good tidings.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But when I behelde, there was none, and when I inquired of them, there was no counsellor, and when I demaunded of them, they answered not a woorde.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Beholde, they are all vanitie: their worke is of nothing, their images are wind and confusion. </div><ul class='tnav'>
