And when she kissed them, they lift vp their voice and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they saide vnto her, Surely we will returne with thee vnto thy people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Naomi saide, Turne againe, my daughters: for what cause will you go with me? are there any more sonnes in my wombe, that they may bee your husbands?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Turne againe, my daughters: go your way: for I am too olde to haue an husband. If I should say, I haue hope, and if I had an husband this night: yea, if I had borne sonnes,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Would yee tarie for them, till they were of age? would ye be deferred for them from taking of husbands? nay my daughters: for it grieueth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then they lift vp their voyce and wept againe, and Orpah kissed her mother in lawe, but Ruth abode still with her.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Naomi said, Beholde, thy sister in law is gone backe vnto her people and vnto her gods: returne thou after thy sister in lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Ruth answered, Intreate mee not to leaue thee, nor to depart from thee: for whither thou goest, I will goe: and where thou dwellest, I will dwell: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried. the Lord do so to me and more also, if ought but death depart thee and me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whe she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left speaking vnto her.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So they went both vntill they came to Beth-lehem: and when they were come to Beth-lehem, it was noysed of them through all the citie, and they said, Is not this Naomi?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And she answered them, Call me not Naomi, but call me Mara: for the Almightie hath giuen me much bitternes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I went out full, and the Lord hath caused me to returne emptie: why call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath humbled me, and the Almightie hath brought me vnto aduersitie?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Naomi returned and Ruth the Moabitesse her daughter in law with her, when she came out of the countrey of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barly haruest. </div><ul class='tnav'>
