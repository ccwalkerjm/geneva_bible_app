She shalbe called woman, because she was taken out of man.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore shall man leaue his father and his mother, and shall cleaue to his wife, and they shall be one flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
