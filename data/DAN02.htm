If ye will not make me vnderstande the dreame with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be drawen in pieces, and your houses shall be made a iakes.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But if yee declare the dreame and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receyue of me gifts and rewardes, and great honour: therefore shewe me the dreame and the interpretation of it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They answered againe, and sayde, Let the King shewe his seruantes the dreame, and wee will declare the interpretation thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the King answered, and sayd, I knowe certeinly that ye would gaine the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But if ye will not declare mee the dreame, there is but one iudgement for you: for ye haue prepared lying and corrupt wordes, to speake before me till the time bee changed: therefore tell me the dreame, that I may knowe, if yee can declare me the interpretation thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the Caldeans answered before the King, and sayde, There is no man vpon earth that can declare the Kings matter: yea, there is neither king nor prince nor lorde that asked such things at an inchanter or astrologian or Caldean.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For it is a rare thing that the King requireth, and there is none other that can declare it before the King, except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For this cause the king was angrie and in great furie, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when sentence was giuen, the wise men were slayne: and they sought Daniel and his fellowes to be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisedome to Arioch the Kings chiefe stewarde, which was gone foorth to put to death the wise men of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yea, he answered and sayde vnto Arioch the kings captaine, Why is the sentence so hastie from the king? Then Arioch declared the thing to Daniel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Daniel went and desired the king that he woulde giue him leasure and that he woulde shewe the king the interpretation thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Daniel went to his house and shewed the matter to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah his companions,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>That they should beseech the God of heauen for grace in this secrete, that Daniel and his fellowes should not perish with the rest of ye wise men of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then was the secret reueiled vnto Daniel in a vision by night: therefore Daniel praysed the God of heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Daniel answered and sayde, The Name of God be praysed for euer and euer: for wisedome and strength are his,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And hee changeth the times and seasons: he taketh away kings: he setteth vp kings: he giueth wisedome vnto the wise, and vnderstanding to those that vnderstand.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Hee discouereth the deepe and secrete things: he knoweth what is in darkenes, and the light dwelleth with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I thanke thee and prayse thee, O thou God of my fathers, that thou hast giuen mee wisedome and strength, and hast shewed me nowe the thing that wee desired of thee: for thou hast declared vnto vs the kings matter.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore Daniel went vnto Arioch, whome the King had ordeyned to destroy the wise men of Babel: he went and sayde thus vnto him, Destroy not the wise men of Babel, but bring me before the King, and I will declare vnto the King the interpretation.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Arioch brought Daniel before the King in all haste, and sayd thus vnto him, I haue found a man of the children of Iudah that were brought captiues, that will declare vnto the King the interpretation.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then answered the King, and sayde vnto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to shew me the dreame, which I haue seene, and the interpretation thereof?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Daniel answered in the presence of the King, and sayd, The secret which the King hath demanded, can neither the wise, the astrologians, the inchanters, nor the southsayers declare vnto the King.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But there is a God in heauen that reueileth secrets, and sheweth the King Nebuchad-nezzar what shall bee in the latter dayes. Thy dreame, and the things which thou hast seene in thine heade vpon thy bed, is this.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>O King, when thou wast in thy bedde, thoughts came into thy mind, what should come to passe hereafter, and he that reueyleth secretes, telleth thee, what shall come.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>As for me, this secret is not shewed mee for any wisedome that I haue, more then any other liuing, but onely to shewe the King the interpretation, and that thou mightest knowe the thoughts of thine heart.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>O King, thou sawest, and beholde, there was a great image: this great image whose glory was so excellent, stood before thee, and the forme thereof was terrible.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This images head was of fine golde, his breast and his armes of siluer, his bellie and his thighs of brasse,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>His legges of yron, and his feete were part of yron, and part of clay.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Thou beheldest it til a stone was cut without hands, which smote the image vpon his feete, that were of yron and clay, and brake them to pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then was the yron, the clay, the brasse, the siluer and the golde broken all together, and became like the chaffe of the sommer floures, and the winde caryed them away, that no place was founde for them: and the stone that smote the image, became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>This is the dreame, and we will declare before the King the interpretation thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>O King, thou art a king of Kings: for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a kingdome, power, and strength, and glorie.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And in all places where the children of men dwell, the beasts of the fielde, and the foules of the heauen hath he giuen into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler ouer them al: thou art this heade of golde.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And after thee shall rise another kingdome, inferiour to thee, of siluer, and another third kingdome shalbe of brasse, which shall beare rule ouer all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And the fourth kingdome shall be strong as yron: for as yron breaketh in pieces, and subdueth all things, and as yron bruiseth all these things, so shall it breake in pieces, and bruise all.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Where as thou sawest the feete and toes, parte of potters clay, and part of yron: the kingdome shalbe deuided, but there shalbe in it of the strength of the yron, as thou sawest the yron mixt with the clay, and earth.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And as the toes of the feete were parte of yron, and parte of clay, so shall the kingdome be partly strong, and partly broken.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And where as thou sawest yron mixt with clay and earth, they shall mingle themselues with the seede of men: but they shall not ioyne one with another, as yron can not bee mixed with clay.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And in the dayes of these Kings, shall the God of heauen set vp a kingdome, which shall neuer be destroyed: and this kingdome shall not be giuen to another people, but it shall breake, and destroy al these kingdomes, and it shall stand for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Where as thou sawest, that the stone was cut of the mountaine without handes, and that it brake in pieces the yron, the brasse, the clay, the siluer, and the golde: so the great God hath shewed the King, what shall come to passe hereafter, and the dreame is true, and the interpretation thereof is sure.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then the King Nebuchad-nezzar fell vpon his face, and bowed himselfe vnto Daniel, and commanded that they should offer meate offrings, and sweete odours vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Also the King answered vnto Daniel, and said, I know of a trueth that your God is a God of gods, and the Lord of Kings, and the reueiler of secrets, seeing thou couldest open this secret.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>So the King made Daniel a great man, and gaue him many and great giftes. Hee made him gouernour ouer the whole prouince of Babel, and chiefe of the rulers, and aboue all the wise men of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Then Daniel made request to the King, and hee set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego ouer the charge of the prouince of Babel: but Daniel sate in the gate of the King. </div><ul class='tnav'>
