And Ham is the father of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>These are the three sonnes of Noah, and of them was the whole earth ouerspred.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Noah also began to be an husband man and planted a vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he drunke of ye wine and was drunken, and was vncouered in the middes of his tent.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when Ham the father of Canaan sawe the nakednesse of his father, he tolde his two brethren without.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then tooke Shem and Iapheth a garment, and put it vpon both their shoulders, and went backwarde, and couered the nakednesse of their father with their faces backwarde: so they sawe not their fathers nakednesse.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his yonger sonne had done vnto him,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And said, Cursed be Canaan: a seruant of seruants shall he be vnto his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He said moreouer, blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and let Canaan be his seruant.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>God perswade Iapheth, that he may dwell in the tentes of Shem, and let Canaan be his seruant.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Noah liued after the flood three hundreth and fiftie yeeres.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So all the dayes of Noah were nine hundreth and fiftie yeeres: and he died. </div><ul class='tnav'>
