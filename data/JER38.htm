And Ieremiah did so.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So they drewe vp Ieremiah with coards and tooke him vp out of the dungeon, and Ieremiah remained in the court of the prison.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Zedekiah the King sent, and tooke Ieremiah the Prophet vnto him, into the thirde entrie that is in the House of the Lord, and the King sayd vnto Ieremiah, I wil aske thee a thing: hide nothing from me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Ieremiah sayd to Zedekiah, If I declare it vnto thee, wilt not thou slay me? and if I giue thee counsell, thou wilt not heare me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the King sware secretly vnto Ieremiah, saying, As the Lord liueth that made vs these soules, I will not slay thee, nor giue thee into the hands of those men that seeke thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then sayd Ieremiah vnto Zedekiah, Thus sayth the Lord God of hostes, the God of Israel, If thou wilt goe foorth vnto the King of Babels princes, then thy soule shall liue, and this citie shall not be burnt vp with fire, and thou shalt liue, and thine house.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if thou wilt not go forth to the King of Babels princes, then shall this citie be giuen into the hand of ye Caldeans, and they shall burne it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Zedekiah the King sayde vnto Ieremiah, I am carefull for the Iewes that are fled vnto the Caldeans, least they deliuer mee into their hands, and they mocke me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But Ieremiah sayd, They shall not deliuer thee: hearken vnto the voyce of the Lord, I beseech thee, which I speake vnto thee: so shall it be well vnto thee, and thy soule shall liue.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But if thou wilt refuse to go forth, this is the worde that the Lord hath shewed me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And beholde, all the women that are left in the King of Iudahs house, shalbe brought forth to the King of Babels princes: and those women shall say, Thy friends haue perswaded thee, and haue preuailed against thee: thy feete are fastened in the myre, and they are turned backe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So they shall bring out all thy wiues, and thy children to the Caldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hands, but shalt be taken by the hand of the King of Babel: and this citie shalt thou cause to be burnt with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then said Zedekiah vnto Ieremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But if ye princes vnderstand that I haue talked with thee, and they come vnto thee, and say vnto thee, Declare vnto vs nowe, what thou hast sayde vnto the King, hide it not from vs, and we will not slay thee: also what the King sayd vnto thee,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then shalt thou say vnto them, I humbly besought the King that he would not cause me to returne to Iehonathans house, to die there.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then came all the princes vnto Ieremiah and asked him. And he tolde them according to all these wordes that the King had commanded: so they left off speaking with him, for the matter was not perceiued.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Ieremiah abode still in the court of the prison, vntill the day that Ierusalem was taken: and he was there, when Ierusalem was taken. </div><ul class='tnav'>
