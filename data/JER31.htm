Rahel weeping for her children, refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, Refraine thy voyce from weeping, and thine eyes from teares: for thy worke shalbe rewarded, saith the Lord, and they shall come againe from the land of the enemie:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And there is hope in thine ende, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come againe to their owne borders.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I haue heard Ephraim lamenting thus, Thou hast corrected me, and I was chastised as an vntamed calfe: conuert thou me, and I shalbe conuerted: for thou art the Lord my God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Surely after that I conuerted, I repented: and after that I was instructed, I smote vpon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, euen confounded, because I did beare the reproch of my youth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Is Ephraim my deare sonne or pleasant childe? yet since I spake vnto him, I still remembred him: therefore my bowels are troubled for him: I wil surely haue compassion vpon him, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Set thee vp signes: make thee heapes: set thine heart towarde the path and way, that thou hast walked: turne againe, O virgine of Israel: turne againe to these thy cities.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>How long wilt thou goe astray, O thou rebellious daughter? for the Lord hath created a newe thing in the earth: A WOMAN shall compasse a man.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Yet shall they say this thing in the land of Iudah, and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring againe their captiuitie, The Lord blesse thee, O habitation of iustice and holy mountaine.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Iudah shall dwell in it, and all the cities thereof together, the husbandmen and they that goe foorth with the flocke.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I haue saciate the wearie soule, and I haue replenished euery sorowfull soule.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore I awaked and behelde, and my sleepe was sweete vnto me.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Beholde, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will sowe the house of Israel, and the house of Iudah with the seede of man and with the seede of beast.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And like as I haue watched vpon them, to plucke vp and to roote out, and to throw downe, and to destroy, and to plague them, so wil I watch ouer them, to build and to plant them, saith ye Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>In those dayes shall they say no more, The fathers haue eaten a sowre grape, and the childrens teeth are set on edge.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But euery one shall die for his owne iniquitie: euery man that eateth the sowre grape, his teeth shalbe set on edge.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Beholde, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new couenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Iudah,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Not according to ye couenant that I made with their fathers, when I tooke them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, the which my couenant they brake, although I was an husband vnto them, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But this shall be the couenant that I will make with the house of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my Lawe in their inward partes, and write it in their hearts, and wil be their God, and they shalbe my people.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they shall teach no more euery man his neighbour and euery man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me from the least of them vnto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I wil forgiue their iniquitie, and will remember their sinnes no more.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, which giueth the sunne for a light to the day, and the courses of the moone and of the starres for a light to the night, which breaketh the sea, when the waues thereof roare: his Name is the Lord of hostes.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>If these ordinances depart out of my sight, saith the Lord, then shall the seede of Israel cease from being a nation before me, for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, If the heauens can be measured, or the fundations of the earth be searched out beneath, then wil I cast off all the seed of Israel, for all that they haue done, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that the citie shalbe built to the Lord from the tower of Hananeel, vnto the gate of the corner.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the line of the measure shall go foorth in his presence vpon the hil Gareb, and shall compasse about to Goath.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields vnto the brooke of Kidron, and vnto the corner of the horsegate toward the East, shalbe holy vnto the Lord, neither shall it be plucked vp nor destroyed any more for euer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
