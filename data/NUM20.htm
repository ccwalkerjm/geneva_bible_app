The Edom came out against him with much people, and with a mightie power.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thus Edom denyed to giue Israel passage through his countrey: wherefore Israel turned away from him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when the children of Israel with al the Congregation departed from Kadesh, they came vnto the mount Hor.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord spake vnto Moses and to Aaron in the mount Hor neere the coast of the land of Edom, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Aaron shall be gathered vnto his people: for hee shall not enter into the lande, which I haue giuen vnto the children of Israel, because ye disobeyed my commandement at the water of Meribah.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Take Aaron and Eleazar his sonne, and bring them vp into the mount Hor,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And cause Aaron to put off his garmentes and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: for Aaron shall be gathered to his fathers, and shall die there.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went vp into the mount Hor, in the sight of all the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Moses put off Aarons clothes, and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: so Aaron dyed there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came downe from off the mount.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When al the Congregation sawe that Aaron was dead, al the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirtie dayes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
