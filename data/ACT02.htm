 <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>How then heare we euery man our owne language, wherein we were borne?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and of Iudea, and of Cappadocia, of Pontus, and Asia,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And of Phrygia, and Pamphylia, of Egypt, and of the partes of Libya, which is beside Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, and Iewes, and Proselytes,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Creetes, and Arabians: wee hearde them speake in our owne tongues the wonderful works of God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They were all then amased, and douted, saying one to another, What may this be?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And others mocked, and saide, They are full of newe wine.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Peter standing with ye Eleuen, lift vp his voice, and said vnto them, Ye men of Iudea, and ye all that inhabite Hierusalem, be this knowen vnto you, and hearken vnto my woordes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For these are not drunken, as yee suppose, since it is but the third houre of the day.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But this is that, which was spoken by the Prophet Ioel,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it shalbe in the last daies, saith God, I wil powre out of my Spirite vpon al flesh, and your sonnes, and your daughters shall prophecie, and your yong men shall see visions, and your old men shall dreame dreames.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And on my seruauntes, and on mine handmaides I will powre out of my Spirite in those daies, and they shall prophecie.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I wil shew wonders in heauen aboue, and tokens in the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and the vapour of smoke.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The Sunne shalbe turned into darkenesse, and the moone into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it shalbe, that whosoeuer shall call on the Name of the Lord, shalbe saued.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yee men of Israel, heare these woordes, JESUS of Nazareth, a man approued of God among you with great workes, and wonders, and signes, which God did by him in the middes of you, as yee your selues also knowe:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Him, I say, being deliuered by the determinate counsell, and foreknowledge of God, after you had taken, with wicked handes you haue crucified and slaine.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Whome God hath raised vp, and loosed the sorrowes of death, because it was vnpossible that he should be holden of it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For Dauid sayeth concerning him, I beheld the Lord alwaies before me: for hee is at my right hand, that I should not be shaken.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore did mine heart reioyce, and my tongue was glad, and moreouer also my flesh shall rest in hope,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Because thou wilt not leaue my soule in graue, neither wilt suffer thine Holy one to see corruption.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thou hast shewed me the waies of life, and shalt make me full of ioy with thy countenance.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Men and brethren, I may boldly speake vnto you of the Patriarke Dauid, that hee is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre remaineth with vs vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore, seeing hee was a Prophet, and knewe that God had sworne with an othe to him, that of the fruite of his loynes hee woulde raise vp Christ concerning the flesh, to set him vpon his throne,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Hee knowing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soule shoulde not bee left in graue, neither his flesh shoulde see corruption.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This Iesus hath God raised vp, whereof we all are witnesses.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Since then that he by the right hande of God hath bene exalted, and hath receiued of his Father the promise of the holy Ghost, hee hath shed foorth this which yee nowe see and heare.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For Dauid is not ascended into heauen, but he sayth, The Lord sayd to my Lord, Sit at my right hande,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Vntill I make thine enemies thy footestoole.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for a suretie, that God hath made him both Lord, and Christ, this Iesus, I say, whome yee haue crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now when they heard it, they were pricked in their heartes, and said vnto Peter and the other Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we doe?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then Peter said vnto them, Amend your liues, and bee baptized euery one of you in the Name of Iesus Christ for the remission of sinnes: and ye shall receiue the gift of the holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For the promise is made vnto you, and to your children, and to all that are a farre off, euen as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And with many other words he besought and exhorted them, saying, Saue your selues from this froward generation.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then they that gladly receiued his word, were baptized: and the same day there were added to the Church about three thousand soules.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they continued in the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and breaking of bread, and prayers.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And feare came vpon euery soule: and many wonders and signes were done by ye Apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And all that beleeued, were in one place, and had all things common.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all me, as euery one had need.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And they continued dayly with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread at home, did eate their meate together with gladnesse and singlenesse of heart,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Praysing God, and had fauour with all the people: and the Lord added to the Church from day to day, such as should be saued. </div><ul class='tnav'>
