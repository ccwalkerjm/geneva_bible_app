The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For we that are many, are one bread and one body, because we all are partakers of one bread.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Beholde Israel, which is after the flesh: are not they which eate of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>What say I then? that the idole is any thing? or that that which is sacrificed to idoles, is any thing?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Nay, but that these things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to deuils, and not vnto God: and I would not that ye should haue fellowship with the deuils.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Ye can not drinke the cup of the Lord, and the cup of the deuils. Ye can not be partakers of the Lords table, and of the table of the deuils.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Doe we prouoke the Lord to anger? are we stronger then he?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawfull for me, but all things edifie not.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Let no man seeke his owne, but euery man anothers wealth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whatsoeuer is solde in the shambles, eate ye, and aske no question for conscience sake.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If any of them which beleeue not, call you to a feast, and if ye wil go, whatsoeuer is set before you, eate, asking no question for conscience sake.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if any man say vnto you, This is sacrificed vnto idoles, eate it not, because of him that shewed it, and for the conscience (for the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is)  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the conscience, I say, not thine, but of that other: for why should my libertie be condemned of another mans conscience?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For if I through Gods benefite be partaker, why am I euill spoken of, for that wherefore I giue thankes?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Whether therefore ye eate, or drinke, or whatsoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glory of God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Giue none offence, neither to the Iewes, nor to the Grecians, nor to the Church of God:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Euen as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine owne profite, but the profite of many, that they might be saued. </div><ul class='tnav'>
