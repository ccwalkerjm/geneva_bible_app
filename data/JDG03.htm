Who said, Keepe silence: and all that stoode about him, went out from him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Ehud came vnto him. (and he sate alone in a sommer parler, which he had) and Ehud said, I haue a message vnto thee from God. Then he arose out of his throne,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and tooke the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his bellie,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So that the hafte went in after the blade, and the fatte closed about the blade, so that he could not drawe the dagger out of his bellie, but the dirt came out.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Ehud gate him out into the porch, and shut the doores of the parler vpon him, and locked them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when he was gone out, his seruantes came: who seeing that the doores of the parler were locked, they sayd, Surely he doeth his easement in his sommer chamber.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they taryed till they were ashamed: and seeing he opened not the doores of the parler, they tooke the key, and opened them, and behold, their lord was fallen dead on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So Ehud escaped (while they taried) and was passed the quarris, and escaped vnto Seirah.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when he came home, he blew a trumpet in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel went downe with him from the mountaine, and he went before them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then said he vnto them, Follow me: for the Lord hath deliuered your enemies, euen Moab into your hand. So they went downe after him, and tooke the passages of Iorden towarde Moab, and suffred not a man to passe ouer.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they slewe of the Moabites the same time about ten thousand men, all fed men, and all were warriours, and there escaped not a man.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So Moab was subdued that daye, vnder the hand of Israel: and the land had rest fourescore yeeres.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And after him was Shamgar the sonne of Anath, which slewe of the Philistims sixe hundreth men with an oxe goade, and he also deliuered Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
