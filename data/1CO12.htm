If the whole were hearing, where were the smellling?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But nowe hath God disposed the members euery one of them in the bodie at his owne pleasure.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For if they were all one member, where were the body?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But now are there many members, yet but one body.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the eye cannot say vnto the hand, I haue no neede of thee: nor the head againe to the feete, I haue no neede of you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yea, much rather those members of the body, which seeme to be more feeble, are necessarie.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And vpon those members of the body, which wee thinke most vnhonest, put wee more honestie on: and our vncomely parts haue more comelinesse on.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For our comely partes neede it not: but God hath tempered the body together, and hath giuen the more honour to that part which lacked,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Lest there should be any diuision in the body: but that the members shoulde haue the same care one for another.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore if one member suffer, all suffer with it: if one member be had in honour, all the members reioyce with it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members for your part.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And God hath ordained some in the Church: as first Apostles, secondly Prophetes, thirdly teachers, then them that doe miracles: after that, the giftes of healing, helpers, gouernours, diuersitie of tongues.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Are all Apostles? are all Prophetes? are all teachers?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Are all doers of miracles? haue all the gifts of healing? doe all speake with tongues? doe all interprete?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But desire you the best giftes, and I will yet shewe you a more excellent way. </div><ul class='tnav'>
