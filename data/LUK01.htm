for I am an olde man, and my wife is of a great age.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Angell answered, and sayde vnto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speake vnto thee, and to shew thee these good tidings.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And beholde, thou shalt be domme, and not be able to speake, vntill the day that these things be done, because thou beleeuedst not my words, which shalbe fulfilled in their season.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now the people waited for Zacharias, and marueiled that he taried so long in the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when hee came out, hee coulde not speake vnto them: then they perceiued that hee had seene a vision in the Temple: For he made signes vnto them, and remained domme.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to passe, when the daies of his office were fulfilled, that he departed to his owne house.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And after those daies, his wife Elisabet conceiued, and hid her selfe fiue moneths, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me, in the daies wherein he looked on me, to take from me my rebuke among men.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And in the sixth moneth, the Angell Gabriel was sent from God vnto a citie of Galile, named Nazareth,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>To a virgin affianced to a man whose name was Ioseph, of the house of Dauid, and the virgins name was Marie.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the Angel went in vnto her, and said, Haile thou that art freely beloued: the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and thought what maner of salutation that should be.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the Angel saide vnto her, Feare not, Marie: for thou hast found fauour with God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For loe, thou shalt conceiue in thy wobe, and beare a sonne, and shalt call his name Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He shall be great, and shall be called the Sonne of the most High, and the Lord God shall giue vnto him the throne of his father Dauid.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And hee shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome shall bee none ende.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then sayde Marie vnto the Angel, How shall this be, seeing I knowe not man?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Angel answered, and said vnto her, The holy Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the most High shall ouershadowe thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall bee borne of thee, shall be called the Sonne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And behold, thy cousin Elisabet, she hath also conceiued a sonne in her olde age: and this is her sixt moneth, which was called barren.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For with God shall nothing be vnpossible.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then Marie said, Behold the seruant of the Lord: be it vnto me according to thy woorde. So the Angel departed from her.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Marie arose in those daies, and went into ye hil countrey with hast to a citie of Iuda,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And entred into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabet.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And it came to passe, as Elisabet heard the salutation of Marie, the babe sprang in her bellie, and Elisabet was filled with the holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And she cried with a loud voice, and saide, Blessed art thou among women, because the fruit of thy wombe is blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And whence commeth this to mee, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For loe, assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares, the babe sprang in my bellie for ioye,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And blessed is shee that beleeued: for those things shall be perfourmed, which were tolde her from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then Marie sayde, My soule magnifieth the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And my spirite reioyceth in God my Sauiour.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>For hee hath looked on the poore degree of his seruaunt: for beholde, from henceforth shall all ages call me blessed,  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Because hee that is mightie, hath done for me great things, and holy is his Name.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And his mercie is from generation to generation on them that feare him.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Hee hath shewed strength with his arme: hee hath scattered the proude in the imagination of their hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Hee hath put downe the mighty from their seates, and exalted them of lowe degree.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Hee hath filled the hungrie with good things, and sent away the rich emptie.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Hee hath vpholden Israel his seruaunt to be mindefull of his mercie  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>(As hee hath spoken to our fathers, to wit, to Abraham, and his seede) for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And Marie abode with her about three moneths: after, shee returned to her owne house.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Nowe Elisabets time was fulfilled, that shee should be deliuered, and shee brought foorth a sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And her neighbours, and cousins heard tell howe the Lord had shewed his great mercie vpon her, and they reioyced with her.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And it was so that on the eight day they came to circumcise the babe, and called him Zacharias after the name of his father.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>But his mother answered, and saide, Not so, but he shalbe called Iohn.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And they saide vnto her, There is none of thy kindred, that is named with this name.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Then they made signes to his father, howe he would haue him called.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>So hee asked for writing tables, and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn, and they marueiled all.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake and praised God.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then feare came on all them that dwelt neere vnto them, and all these woordes were noised abroade throughout all the hill countrey of Iudea.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And al they that heard them, laid them vp in their hearts, saying, What maner childe shall this be! and the hand of the Lord was with him.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Then his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because he hath visited and redeemed his people,  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And hath raised vp the horne of saluation vnto vs, in the house of his seruant Dauid,  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>As he spake by ye mouth of his holy Prophets, which were since the world began, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>That he would sende vs deliuerance from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate vs,  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>That he might shewe mercie towards our fathers, and remember his holy couenant,  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>And the othe which he sware to our father Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>Which was, that he would graunt vnto vs, that we being deliuered out of the handes of our enemies, should serue him without feare,  <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>All the daies of our life, in holinesse and righteousnesse before him.  <span class="verse" id="V76">76&#160;</span>And thou, babe, shalt be called the Prophet of the most High: for thou shalt goe before the face of the Lord, to prepare his waies,  <span class="verse" id="V77">77&#160;</span>And to giue knowledge of saluation vnto his people, by the remission of their sinnes,  <span class="verse" id="V78">78&#160;</span>Through ye tender mercy of our God, wherby the day spring from an hie hath visited vs,  <span class="verse" id="V79">79&#160;</span>To giue light to them that sit in darknes, and in the shadow of death, and to guide our feete into the way of peace.  <span class="verse" id="V80">80&#160;</span>And the childe grewe, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the wildernesse, til the day came that he should shewe him selfe vnto Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
