Then he sayd, I pray thee, bring them to me, that I may blesse them:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>(For the eyes of Israel were dimme for age, so that hee coulde not well see) Then he caused them to come to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Israel sayde vnto Ioseph, I had not thought to haue seene thy face: yet lo, God hath shewed me also thy seede.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Ioseph tooke them away from his knees, and did reuerence downe to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then tooke Ioseph them both, Ephraim in his right hand towarde Israels left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israels right hand, so he brought them vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Israel stretched out his right hand, and layde it on Ephraims head, which was the yonger, and his left hande vpon Manassehs head (directing his handes of purpose) for Manasseh was the elder.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Also he blessed Ioseph and sayde, The God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Izhak did walke, the God, which hath fed me al my life long vnto this day, blesse thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The Angel, which hath deliuered me from all euill, blesse the children, and let my name be named vpon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Izhak, that they may growe as fish into a multitude in the middes of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But when Ioseph sawe that his father layde his right hande vpon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he stayed his fathers hand to remooue it from Ephraims head to Manassehs head.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Ioseph sayde vnto his father, Not so, my father, for this is the eldest: put thy right hand vpon his head.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But his father refused, and sayd, I know well, my sonne, I know well: he shalbe also a people, and he shalbe great likewise: but his yonger brother shalbe greater then he, and his seede shall be full of nations.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So he blessed them that day, and sayde, In thee Israel shall blesse, and say, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Israel said vnto Ioseph, Behold, I die, and God shall be with you, and bring you againe vnto the land of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moreouer, I haue giuen vnto thee one portion aboue thy brethren, which I gate out of the hand of the Amorite by my sworde and by my bowe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
