I haue shewed thee newe things, euen now, and hid things, which thou knewest not.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They are created now, and not of olde, and euen before this thou heardest them not, lest thou shouldest say, Beholde, I knewe them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Yet thou heardest them not, neither diddest know them, neither yet was thine eare opened of olde: for I knewe that thou wouldest grieuously transgresse: therefore haue I called thee a transgressour from the wombe.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For my Names sake will I defer my wrath, and for my praise will I refraine it from thee, that I cut thee not off.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold, I haue fined thee, but not as siluer: I haue chosen thee in the fornace of affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For mine owne sake, for mine owne sake wil I doe it: for how should my Name be polluted? surely I wil not giue my glory vnto another.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Heare me, O Iaakob and Israel, my called, I am, I am the first, and I am the last.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Surely mine hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heaues: when I cal them, they stand vp together.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>All you, assemble your selues, and heare: which among them hath declared these thinges? The Lord hath loued him: he wil doe his will in Babel, and his arme shalbe against the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I, euen I haue spoken it, and I haue called him: I haue brought him, and his way shall prosper.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Come neere vnto me: heare ye this: I haue not spoken it in secret from the beginning: from the time that the thing was, I was there, and now the Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, the Holy one of Israel, I am the Lord thy God, which teach thee to profite, and lead thee by the way, that thou shouldest goe.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Oh that thou haddest hearkened to my commandements! then had thy prosperitie bene as the floude, and thy righteousnesse as the waues of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thy seede also had beene as the sande, and the fruite of thy body like the grauell thereof: his name should not haue bene cut off nor destroied before me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Goe yee out of Babel: flee yee from the Chaldeans, with a voice of ioy: tel and declare this: shewe it foorth to the ende of the earth: say yee, The Lord hath redeemed his seruant Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they were not thirstie: hee led them through the wildernesse: hee caused the waters to flowe out of the rocke for them: for he claue the rocke, and the water gushed out.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There is no peace, sayeth the Lord, vnto the wicked. </div><ul class='tnav'>
