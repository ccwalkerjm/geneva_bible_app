Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth mine hands to fight, and my fingers to battell.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He is my goodnes and my fortresse, my towre and my deliuerer, my shield, and in him I trust, which subdueth my people vnder me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Lord, what is man that thou regardest him! or the sonne of man that thou thinkest vpon him!  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Man is like to vanitie: his dayes are like a shadow, that vanisheth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Bow thine heauens, O Lord, and come downe: touch the mountaines and they shall smoke.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Cast forth the lightning and scatter them: shoote out thine arrowes, and consume them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Send thine hand from aboue: deliuer me, and take me out of the great waters, and from the hand of strangers,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Whose mouth talketh vanitie, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I wil sing a new song vnto thee, O God, and sing vnto thee vpon a viole, and an instrument of ten strings.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>It is he that giueth deliuerance vnto Kings, and rescueth Dauid his seruant from the hurtfull sworde.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Rescue me, and deliuer me from the hand of strangers, whose mouth talketh vanitie, and their right hand is a right hand of falshood:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>That our sonnes may be as the plantes growing vp in their youth, and our daughters as the corner stones, grauen after the similitude of a palace:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>That our corners may be full, and abounding with diuers sorts, and that our sheepe may bring forth thousands and ten thousand in our streetes:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That our oxen may be strong to labour: that there be none inuasion, nor going out, nor no crying in our streetes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Blessed are the people, that be so, yea, blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
