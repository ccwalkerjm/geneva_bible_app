Speake ye euery man the trueth vnto his neighbour: execute iudgement truely and vprightly in your gates,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And let none of you imagine euill in your hearts against his neighbour, and loue no false othe: for all these are the things that I hate, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the worde of the Lord of hostes came vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, The fast of the fourth moneth, and the fast of the fift, and the fast of the seuenth, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Iudah ioy and gladnes, and prosperous hie feasts: therefore loue the trueth and peace.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord of hostes, That there shall yet come people, and the inhabitants of great cities.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they that dwell in one citie, shall go to another, saying, Vp, let vs go and pray before the Lord, and seeke the Lord of hostes: I wil go also.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yea, great people and mightie nations shall come to seeke the Lord of hostes in Ierusalem, and to pray before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, In those dayes shall ten men take holde out of all languages of the nations, euen take holde of the skirt of him that is a Iewe, and say, We will go with you: for we haue heard that God is with you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
