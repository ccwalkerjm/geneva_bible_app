The God of Gods, euen the Lord hath spoken and called the earth from the rising vp of the sunne vnto the going downe thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Out of Zion, which is the perfection of beautie, hath God shined.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Our God shall come and shall not keepe silence: a fire shall deuoure before him, and a mightie tempest shall be mooued round about him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Hee shall call the heauen aboue, and the earth to iudge his people.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Gather my Saints together vnto me, those that make a couenant with me with sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the heauens shall declare his righteousnes: for God is iudge himselfe. Selah.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Heare, O my people, and I wil speake: heare, O Israel, and I wil testifie vnto thee: for I am God, euen thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I wil not reproue thee for thy sacrifices, or thy burnt offerings, that haue not bene continually before me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will take no bullocke out of thine house, nor goates out of thy foldes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For all the beastes of the forest are mine, and the beastes on a thousand mountaines.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I knowe all the foules on the mountaines: and the wilde beastes of the fielde are mine.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If I bee hungry, I will not tell thee: for the world is mine, and all that therein is.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Will I eate the flesh of bulles? or drinke the blood of goates?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Offer vnto God praise, and pay thy vowes vnto the most High,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And call vpon me in the day of trouble: so will I deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But vnto the wicked said God, What hast thou to doe to declare mine ordinances, that thou shouldest take my couenant in thy mouth,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Seeing thou hatest to bee reformed, and hast cast my wordes behinde thee?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For when thou seest a thiefe, thou runnest with him, and thou art partaker with the adulterers.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou giuest thy mouth to euill, and with thy tongue thou forgest deceit.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou sittest, and speakest against thy brother, and slanderest thy mothers sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue: therefore thou thoughtest that I was like thee: but I will reproue thee, and set them in order before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Oh cosider this, ye that forget God, least I teare you in pieces, and there be none that can deliuer you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that offereth praise, shall glorifie mee: and to him, that disposeth his way aright, will I shew the saluation of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
