Where is thy zeale and thy strength, the multitude of thy mercies, and of thy compassions? they are restrained from me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Doutles thou art our Father: though Abraham be ignorant of vs, and Israel knowe vs not, yet thou, O Lord, art our Father, and our redeemer: thy Name is for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>O Lord, why hast thou made vs to erre from thy wayes? and hardened our heart from thy feare? Returne for thy seruants sake, and for the tribes of thine inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The people of thine holinesse haue possessed it, but a litle while: for our aduersaries haue troden downe thy Sanctuarie.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>We haue bene as they, ouer whome thou neuer barest rule, and vpon whom thy Name was not called. </div><ul class='tnav'>
