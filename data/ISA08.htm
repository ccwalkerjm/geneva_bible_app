Then sayd the Lord to me, Call his name, Mahershalalhash-baz.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For before the childe shall haue knowledge to crye, My father, and my mother, he shall take away the riches of Damascus and the spoyle of Samaria, before the King of Asshur.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord spake yet againe vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Because this people hath refused the waters of Shiloah that runne softly, and reioyce with Rezin, and the sonne of Remaliah,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Nowe therefore, beholde, the Lord bringeth vp vpon them the waters of the Riuer mightie and great, euen the King of Asshur with all his glory, and he shall come vp vpon all their riuers, and goe ouer all their banks,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And shall breake into Iudah, and shall ouerflowe and passe through, and shall come vp to the necke, and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanu-el.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Gather together on heapes, O ye people, and ye shalbe broken in pieces, and hearken all ye of farre countreys: gird your selues, and you shalbe broken in pieces: gird your selues, and you shalbe broken in pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Take counsell together, yet it shall be brought to nought: pronounce a decree, yet shall it not stand: for God is with vs.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the Lord spake thus to me in taking of mine hand, and taught me, that I should not walke in the way of this people, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Say ye not, A confederacie to all them, to whome this people sayth a confederacie, neither feare you their feare, nor be afrayd of them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sanctifie the Lord of hostes, and let him be your feare, and let him be your dread,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he shalbe as a Sanctuarie: but as a stumbling stone, and as a rocke to fall vpon, to both the houses of Israel, and as a snare and as a net to the inhabitants of Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And many among them shall stumble, and shall fall and shalbe broken and shalbe snared and shalbe taken.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Binde vp the testimonie: seale vp the Law among my disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore I will waite vpon the Lord that hath hid his face from the house of Iaakob, and I wil looke for him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Beholde, I and the children whome the Lord hath giuen me, are as signes and as wonders in Israel, by the Lord of hostes, which dwelleth in mount Zion.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when they shall say vnto you, Enquire at them that haue a spirit of diuination, and at the soothsayers, which whisper and murmure, Should not a people enquire at their God? from the liuing to the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>To the Law, and to the testimonie, if they speake not according to this worde: it is because there is no light in them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then he that is afflicted and famished, shall go to and from in it: and when he shalbe hungry, he shall euen freat himselfe, and curse his King and his gods, and shall looke vpward.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when he shall looke to the earth, beholde trouble, and darkenes, vexation and anguish, and he is driuen to darkenes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
