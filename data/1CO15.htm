<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 15</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Moreouer brethren, I declare vnto you the Gospel, which I preached vnto you, which ye haue also receiued, and wherein ye continue,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And whereby ye are saued, if ye keepe in memorie, after what maner I preached it vnto you, except ye haue beleeued in vaine.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For first of all, I deliuered vnto you that which I receiued, how that Christ died for our sinnes, according to the Scriptures,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And that he was buried, and that he arose the third day, according to the Scriptures,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And that he was seene of Cephas, then of the twelue.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>After that, he was seene of more then fiue hudreth brethren at once: whereof many remaine vnto this present, and some also are asleepe.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>After that, he was seene of Iames: then of all the Apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And last of all he was seene also of me, as of one borne out of due time.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For I am the least of the Apostles, which am not meete to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But by the grace of God, I am that I am: and his grace which is in me, was not in vaine: but I laboured more aboundantly then they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wherefore, whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so haue ye beleeued.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now if it be preached, that Christ is risen from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vaine, and your faith is also vaine.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And we are found also false witnesses of God: for we haue testified of God, that he hath raised vp Christ: whome he hath not raised vp, if so be the dead be not raised.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For if the dead be not raised, then is Christ not raised.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vaine: ye are yet in your sinnes.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And so they which are a sleepe in Christ, are perished.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If in this life onely wee haue hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But nowe is Christ risen from the dead, and was made the first fruites of them that slept.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For as in Adam all die, euen so in Christ shall all be made aliue,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But euery man in his owne order: the first fruites is Christ, afterward, they that are of Christ, at his comming shall rise againe.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then shalbe the end, when he hath deliuered vp the kingdome to God, euen the Father, when he hath put downe all rule, and all authoritie and power.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For he must reigne till hee hath put all his enemies vnder his feete.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The last enemie that shalbe destroyed, is death.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For he hath put downe all things vnder his feete. (And when he saith that all things are subdued to him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put downe all things vnder him.)  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when all things shalbe subdued vnto him, then shall the Sonne also himselfe be subiect vnto him, that did subdue all things vnder him, that God may be all in all.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Els what shall they doe which are baptized for dead? if the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for dead?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Why are wee also in ieopardie euery houre?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>By your reioycing which I haue in Christ Iesus our Lord, I die dayly.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If I haue fought with beastes at Ephesus after ye maner of men, what aduantageth it me, if the dead be not raised vp? let vs eate and drinke: for to morowe we shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Be not deceiued: euill speakings corrupt good maners.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Awake to liue righteously, and sinne not: for some haue not ye knowledge of God, I speake this to your shame.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But some man will say, Howe are the dead raised vp? and with what body come they foorth?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>O foole, that which thou sowest, is not quickened, except it die.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shalbe, but bare corne as it falleth, of wheat, or of some other.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But God giueth it a body at his pleasure, euen to euery seede his owne body,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beastes, and another of fishes, and another of birdes.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>There are also heauenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but the glorie of the heauenly is one, and the glorie of the earthly is another.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>There is another glorie of the sunne, and another glorie of the moone, and another glorie of the starres: for one starre differeth from another starre in glorie.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>So also is the resurrection of the dead. The bodie is sowen in corruption, and is raysed in incorruption.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>It is sowen in dishonour, and is raysed in glory: it is sowen in weakenesse, and is raysed in power.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>It is sowen a naturall body, and is raysed a spirituall body: there is a naturall body, and there is a spirituall body.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>As it is also written, The first man Adam was made a liuing soule: and the last Adam was made a quickening Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Howbeit that was not first which is spirituall: but that which is naturall, and afterward that which is spirituall.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The first man is of the earth, earthly: the second man is the Lord from heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>As is the earthly, such are they that are earthly: and as is the heauenly, such are they also that are heauenly.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And as we haue borne the image of the earthly, so shall we beare the image of the heauenly.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>This say I, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherite the kingdome of God, neither doeth corruption inherite incorruption.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Behold, I shewe you a secret thing, We shall not all sleepe, but we shall all be changed,  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>In a moment, in the twinckling of an eye at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall blow, and the dead shalbe raysed vp incorruptible, and we shalbe changed.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortall must put on immortalitie.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>So when this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortall hath put on immortalitie, then shalbe brought to passe the saying that is written, Death is swallowed vp into victorie.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>O death where is thy sting? O graue where is thy victorie?  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>The sting of death is sinne: and ye strength of sinne is the Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>But thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Therefore my beloued brethren, be ye stedfast, vnmoueable, aboundant alwayes in the worke of the Lord, forasmuch as ye knowe that your labour is not in vaine in the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
