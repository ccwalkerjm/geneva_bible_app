 <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he answered me, Vnto the euening and the morning, two thousand and three hundreth: then shall the Sanctuarie be clensed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nowe when I Daniel had seene the vision, and sought for the meaning, beholde, there stoode before me like the similitude of a man.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I heard a mans voyce betweene the bankes of Vlai, which called, and sayde, Gabriel, make this man to vnderstand the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So he came where I stood: and when hee came, I was afraide, and fell vpon my face: but he sayd vnto me, Vnderstand, O sonne of man: for in the last time shalbe the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Nowe as he was speaking vnto me, I being a sleepe fell on my face to the ground: but he touched me, and set me vp in my place.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he sayde, Beholde, I will shewe thee what shalbe in the last wrath: for in the end of the time appointed it shall come.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The ramme which thou sawest hauing two hornes, are the Kings of the Medes and Persians.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the goate is the King of Grecia, and the great horne that is betweene his eyes, is the first King.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And that that is broken, and foure stoode vp for it, are foure kingdomes, which shall stand vp of that nation, but not in his strength.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And in the end of their kingdome, when the rebellious shalbe consumed, a King of fierce countenance, and vnderstanding darke sentences, shall stand vp.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And his power shalbe mightie, but not in his strength: and hee shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mightie, and the holy people.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And through his policie also, hee shall cause craft to prosper in his hand, and he shall extoll himselfe in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: hee shall also stande vp against the prince of princes, but he shalbe broken downe without hand.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the vision of the euening and the morning, which is declared, is true: therefore seale thou vp the vision, for it shall be after many dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I Daniel was striken and sicke certaine dayes: but when I rose vp, I did the Kings busines, and I was astonished at the vision, but none vnderstood it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
