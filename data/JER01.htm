And I said, I see a rod of an almonde tree.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then saide the Lord vnto me, Thou hast seene aright: for I will hasten my worde to performe it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I saide, I see a seething pot looking out of the North.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then saide the Lord vnto me, Out of the North shall a plague be spred vpon all the inhabitants of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For loe, I will call all the families of the kingdomes of the North, saith the Lord, and they shall come, and euery one shall set his throne in the entring of the gates of Ierusalem, and on all the walles thereof rounde about, and in all the cities of Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will declare vnto them my iudgements touching all the wickednesse of them that haue forsaken me, and haue burnt incense vnto other gods, and worshipped the workes of their owne handes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou therefore trusse vp thy loynes, and arise and speake vnto them all that I commaund thee: be not afraide of their faces, lest I destroy thee before them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I, beholde, I this day haue made thee a defenced citie, and an yron pillar and walles of brasse against the whole lande, against the Kings of Iudah, and against the princes thereof, against the Priestes thereof and against the people of the lande.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For they shall fight against thee, but they shall not preuaile against thee: for I am with thee to deliuer thee, sayth the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
