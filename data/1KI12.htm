And the people departed.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And King Rehoboam tooke counsell with the olde men that had stande before Salomon his father, while he yet liued, and sayde, What counsell giue ye, that I may make an answere to this people?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they spake vnto him, saying, If thou be a seruant vnto this people this day, and serue them, and answere them, and speake kinde wordes to them, they will be thy seruants for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But he forsooke the counsell that the olde men had giuen him, and asked counsell of the yong men that had bene brought vp with him, and waited on him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said vnto them, What counsell giue ye, that we may answere this people, which haue spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke, which thy father did put vpon vs, lighter?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the yong men that were brought vp with him, spake vnto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say vnto this people, that haue spoken vnto thee, and said, Thy father hath made our yoke heauie, but make thou it lighter vnto vs: euen thus shalt thou say vnto them, My least part shalbe bigger then my fathers loynes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now where as my father did burden you with a grieuous yoke, I will yet make your yoke heauier: my father hath chastised you with rods, but I will correct you with scourges.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Ieroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me againe ye thirde day.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the king answered the people sharpely, and left the old mens counsell that they gaue him,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And spake to them after the counsell of the yong men, saying, My father made your yoke grieuous, and I will make your yoke more grieuous: my father hath chastised you with rods, but I will correct you with scourges.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the King hearkened not vnto the people: for it was the ordinance of the Lord, that he might perfourme his saying, which the Lord had spoken by Ahiiah the Shilonite vnto Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So when all Israel sawe that the King regarded them not, the people answered the King thus, saying, What portion haue we in Dauid? we haue none inheritance in the sonne of Ishai. To your tents, O Israel: nowe see to thine owne house, Dauid. So Israel departed vnto their tents.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Howbeit ouer the children of Israel, which dwelt in the cities of Iudah, did Rehoboam reigne still.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Nowe the King Rehoboam sent Adoram the receiuer of the tribute, and all Israel stoned him to death: then King Rehoboam made speede to get him vp to his charet, to flee to Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Israel rebelled against the house of Dauid vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when all Israel had heard that Ieroboam was come againe, they sent and called him vnto the assemblie, and made him King ouer all Israel: none followed the house of Dauid, but the tribe of Iudah onely.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when Rehoboam was come to Ierusalem, he gathered all the house of Iudah with the tribe of Beniamin an hundreth and foure score thousand of chosen men (which were good warriours) to fight against the house of Israel, and to bring the kingdome againe to Rehoboam the sonne of Salomon.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the worde of God came vnto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Speake vnto Rehoboam the sonne of Salomon King of Iudah, and vnto all the house of Iudah and Beniamin, and the remnant of the people, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go vp, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: returne euery man to his house: for this thing is done by me. They obeyed therefore the worde of the Lord and returned, and departed, according to the worde of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Ieroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein, and went from thence, and built Penuel.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Ieroboam thought in his heart, Nowe shall the kingdome returne to the house of Dauid.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If this people goe vp and doe sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Ierusalem, then shall the heart of this people turne againe vnto their lorde, euen to Rehoboam King of Iudah: so shall they kill me and goe againe to Rehoboam King of Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Whereupon the King tooke counsell, and made two calues of golde, and saide vnto them, It is too much for you to goe vp to Ierusalem: beholde, O Israel, thy gods, which brought thee vp out of the lande of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other set he in Dan.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And this thing turned to sinne: for the people went (because of the one) euen to Dan.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Also he made an house of hie places, and made Priestes of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sonnes of Leui.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Ieroboam made a feast the fifteenth day of the eight moneth, like vnto the feast that is in Iudah, and offred on the altar. So did he in Beth-el and offered vnto the calues that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the Priestes of the hie places, which he had made.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he offered vpon the altar, which he had made in Beth-el, the fifteenth day of the eight moneth, (euen in the moneth which he had forged of his owne heart) and made a solemne feast vnto the children of Israel: and he went vp to the altar, to burne incense. </div><ul class='tnav'>
