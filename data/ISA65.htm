<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 65</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I have bene sought of them that asked not: I was found of them that sought me not: I sayd, Beholde me, beholde me, vnto a nation that called not vpon my Name.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I haue spred out mine handes all the day vnto a rebellious people, which walked in a way that was not good, euen after their owne imaginations:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A people that prouoked me euer vnto my face: that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense vpon brickes.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Which remaine among the graues, and lodge in the desarts, which eate swines flesh, and the broth of things polluted are in their vessels.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Which say, Stand apart, come not neere to me: for I am holier then thou: these are a smoke in my wrath and a fire that burneth all the day.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Beholde, it is written before me: I wil not keepe silence, but will render it and recompense it into their bosome.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers shalbe together (sayth the Lord) which haue burnt incense vpon the mountaines, and blasphemed me vpon the hilles: therefore wil I measure their olde worke into their bosome.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord, As the wine is found in the cluster, and one sayth, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it, so will I doe for my seruants sakes, that I may not destroy them whole.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But I will bring a seede out of Iaakob, and out of Iudah, that shall inherit my mountaine: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my seruants shall dwell there.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Sharon shalbe a sheepefolde, and the valley of Achor shalbe a resting place for the cattell of my people, that haue sought me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But ye are they that haue forsaken the Lord and forgotten mine holy Mountaine, and haue prepared a table for the multitude, and furnish the drinke offerings vnto the number.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore wil I number you to the sword, and all you shall bowe downe to the slaughter, because I called, and ye did not answere: I spake, and ye heard not, but did euil in my sight, and did chuse that thing which I would not.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, my seruants shall eate, and ye shalbe hungrie: beholde, my seruants shall drinke, and ye shall be thirstie: beholde, my seruants shall reioyce, and ye shalbe ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Beholde, my seruants shall sing for ioye of heart, and ye shall crye for sorow of heart, and shall howle for vexation of minde.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And ye shall leaue your name as a curse vnto my chosen: for the Lord God shall slay you and call his seruants by another name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that shall blesse in the earth, shall blesse himselfe in the true God, and he that sweareth in the earth, shall sweare by the true God: for the former troubles are forgotten, and shall surely hide themselues from mine eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For lo, I will create newe heauens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembred nor come into minde.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But be you glad and reioyce for euer in the things that I shall create: for beholde, I will create Ierusalem, as a reioycing and her people as a ioye,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I wil reioyce in Ierusalem, and ioye in my people, and the voyce of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voyce of crying.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There shall be no more there a childe of yeeres, nor an olde man that hath not filled his dayes: for he that shall be an hundreth yeeres old, shall dye as a yong man: but the sinner being an hundreth yeeres olde shall be accursed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they shall build houses and inhabite them, and they shall plant vineyards, and eate the fruite of them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They shall not build, and another inhabite: they shall not plant, and another eate: for as the dayes of the tree are the dayes of my people, and mine elect shall inioye in olde age the worke of their handes.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They shall not labour in vaine, nor bring forth in feare: for they are the seede of the blessed of the Lord, and their buds with them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Yea, before they call, I will answere, and whiles they speake, I will heare.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The wolfe and the lambe shall feede together, and the lyon shall eate strawe like the bullocke: and to the serpent dust shall be his meate. They shall no more hurt nor destroy in all mine holy Mountaine, saith the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
