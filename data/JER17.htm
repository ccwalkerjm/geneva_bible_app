 <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I the Lord search the heart, and try ye reines, euen to giue euery man according to his wayes, and according to the fruite of his workes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As the partryche gathereth the yong, which she hath not brought forth: so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leaue them in the middes of his dayes, and at his ende shall bee a foole.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As a glorious throne exalted from the beginning, so is the place of our Sanctuarie.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O Lord, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee, shall be confounded: they that depart from thee, shalbe written in the earth, because they haue forsaken the Lord, the fountaine of liuing waters.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Heale me, O Lord, and I shall bee whole: saue me, and I shall bee saued: for thou art my prayse.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, they say vnto me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come nowe.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But I haue not thrust in my selfe for a pastour after thee, neither haue I desired the day of miserie, thou knowest: that which came out of my lips, was right before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Be not terrible vnto mee: thou art mine hope in the day of aduersitie.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let them bee confounded, that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be afraide, but let not me be afraide: bring vpon them the day of aduersitie, and destroy them with double destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thus hath the Lord said vnto me, Goe and stande in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the Kings of Iudah come in, and by the which they goe out, and in all ye gates of Ierusalem,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And say vnto them, Heare the word of the Lord, ye Kings of Iudah, and al Iudah, and all the inhabitants of Ierusale, that enter in by these gates.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord, Take heede to your soules, and beare no burden in the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Neither cary foorth burdens out of your houses in the Sabbath day: neither doe yee any worke, but sanctifie the Sabbath, as I commanded your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they obeied not, neither inclined their eares, but made their neckes stiffe and would not heare, nor receiue correction.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse if ye will heare me, sayth the Lord, and beare no burden through the gates of the citie in the Sabbath day, but sanctifie ye Sabbath day, so that ye do no worke therein,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then shall the Kings and the princes enter in at the gates of this citie, and shall sit vpon the throne of Dauid, and shall ride vpon charets, and vpon horses, both they and their princes, the men of Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem: and this citie shall remaine for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall come from the cities of Iudah, and from about Ierusalem, and from the land of Beniamin, and from the plaine, and from the mountaines, and from the South, which shall bring burnt offrings, and sacrifices, and meate offrings, and incense, and shall bring sacrifice of prayse into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But if ye will not heare me to sanctifie the Sabbath day, and not to beare a burden nor to go through the gates of Ierusalem in the Sabbath day, then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Ierusalem, and it shall not be quenched. </div><ul class='tnav'>
