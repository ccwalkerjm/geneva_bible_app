And the Angel that talked with me, sayde vnto me, I wil shew thee what these be.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the man that stood among the mirre trees, answered, and sayd, These are they whome the Lord hath sent to go through the world.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they answered the Angel of the Lord, that stood among the mirre trees, and sayd, We haue gone thorowe the world: and beholde, all the world sitteth still, and is at rest.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the Angel of the Lord answered and sayd, O Lord of hostes, howe long wilt thou be vnmercifull to Ierusalem, and to the cities of Iudah, with whom thou hast bene displeased now these threescore and ten yeeres?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord answered the Angel that talked with me, with good wordes and comfortable wordes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the Angel that communed with me, said vnto me, Crie thou, and speake, Thus saith the Lord of hostes, I am ielous ouer Ierusalem and Zion with a great zeale,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And am greatly angrie against the carelesse heathen: for I was angrie but a litle, and they helped forward the affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord, I wil returne vnto Ierusalem with tender mercie: mine house shall be builded in it, saith the Lord of hostes, and a line shall be stretched vpon Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Cry yet, and speake, Thus saith the Lord of hostes, My cities shall yet be broken with plentie: the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet chuse Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then lift I vp mine eyes and sawe, and beholde, foure hornes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I said vnto the Angel that talked with me, What be these? And hee answered me, These are the hornes which haue scattered Iudah, Israel, and Ierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord shewed me foure carpenters.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then said I, What come these to doe? And he answered, and said, These are the hornes, which haue scattered Iudah, so that a man durst not lift vp his head: but these are come to fray them, and to cast out the hornes of the Gentiles, which lift vp their horne ouer the land of Iudah, to scatter it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
