And the Ethiopians hoste was ouerthrowen, so that there was no life in them: for they were destroyed before the Lord and before his hoste: and they caryed away a mightie great spoyle.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they smote all the cities rounde about Gerar: for the feare of the Lord came vpon them, and they spoyled all the cities, for there was exceeding much spoyle in them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yea, and they smote the tents of cattel, and carried away plentie of sheepe and camels, and returned to Ierusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
