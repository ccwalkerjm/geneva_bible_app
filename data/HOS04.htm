Nowe the Lord will feede them as a lambe in a large place.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Ephraim is ioyned to idoles: let him alone.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Their drunkennes stinketh: they haue committed whoredome: their rulers loue to say with shame, Bring ye.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The winde hath bounde them vp in her wings, and they shalbe ashamed of their sacrifices. </div><ul class='tnav'>
