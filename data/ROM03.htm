<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>What is then the preferment of the Iewe? or what is the profite of circumcision?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Much euery maner of way: for chiefly, because vnto them were of credite committed the oracles of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For what, though some did not beleeue? shall their vnbeliefe make the faith of God without effect?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>God forbid: yea, let God be true, and euery man a lyar, as it is written, That thou mightest be iustified in thy words, and ouercome, when thou art iudged.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now if our vnrighteousnes comend the righteousnes of God, what shall we say? Is God vnrighteous which punisheth? (I speake as a man.)  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God forbid: els how shall God iudge ye world?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For if the veritie of God hath more abounded through my lye vnto his glorie, why am I yet condemned as a sinner?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And (as we are blamed, and as some affirme, that we say) why doe we not euil, that good may come thereof? whose damnation is iust.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What then? are we more excellent? No, in no wise: for we haue alreadie prooued, that all, both Iewes and Gentiles are vnder sinne,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is none that vnderstandeth: there is none that seeketh God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They haue all gone out of the way: they haue bene made altogether vnprofitable: there is none that doeth good, no not one.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Their throte is an open sepulchre: they haue vsed their tongues to deceit: the poyson of aspes is vnder their lippes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitternesse.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Their feete are swift to shead blood.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Destruction and calamity are in their waies,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And ye way of peace they haue not knowen.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The feare of God is not before their eies.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now we know that whatsoeuer ye Lawe saieth, it saieth it to them which are vnder ye Law, that euery mouth may bee stopped, and all the world be subiect to the iudgement of God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore by the woorkes of the Lawe shall no flesh be iustified in his sight: for by the Lawe commeth the knowledge of sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But nowe is the righteousnesse, of God made manifest without the Lawe, hauing witnes of the Lawe and of the Prophets,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>To wit, the righteousnesse of God by the faith of Iesus Christ, vnto all, and vpon all that beleeue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For there is no difference: for all haue sinned, and are depriued of the glorie of God,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And are iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Iesus,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whom God hath set forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousnes, by the forgiuenesse of the sinnes that are passed,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Through the patience of God, to shewe at this time his righteousnesse, that hee might be iust, and a iustifier of him which is of the faith of Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Where is then the reioycing? It is excluded. By what Lawe? of woorkes? Nay: but by the Lawe of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore we conclude, that a man is iustified by faith, without the workes of the Lawe.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God, is he the God of the Iewes onely, and not of the Gentiles also? Yes, euen of the Gentiles also.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For it is one God, who shall iustifie circumcision of faith, and vncircumcision through faith.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Doe we then make the Lawe of none effect through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the Lawe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
