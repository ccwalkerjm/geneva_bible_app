<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These are now the chiefe fathers of them, and the genealogie of them that came vp with mee from Babel, in the reigne of King Artahshashte.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Of the sonnes of Phinehas, Gershom: of the sonnes of Ithamar, Daniel: of the sonnes of Dauid, Hattush:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Of the sonnes of Shechaniah, of the sonnes of Pharosh, Zechariah, and with him the count of the males, an hundreth and fiftie.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Of the sonnes of Pahath Moab, Elihoenai, the sonne of Zerahiah, and with him two hundreth males.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Of the sonnes of Shechaniah, the sonne of Iahaziel, and with him three hundreth males.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And of the sonnes of Adin, Ebed the sonne of Ionathan, and with him fiftie males.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And of the sonnes of Elam, Ieshaiah the sonne of Athaliah, and with him seuentie males.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And of the sonnes of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the sonne of Michael, and with him fourescore males.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Of the sonnes of Ioab, Obadiah the sonne of Iehiel, and with him two hundreth and eighteene males.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And of the sonnes of Shelomith the sonne of Iosiphiah, and with him an hundreth and threescore males.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And of the sonnes of Bebai, Zechariah the sonne of Bebai, and with him eight and twentie males.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And of the sonnes of Azgad, Iohanan the sonne of Hakkatan, and with him an hundreth and ten males.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And of the sonnes of Adonikam, that were the last, whose names are these: Eliphelet, Iehiel and Shemaiah, and with them three score males.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And of the sonnes of Biguai, Vthai, and Zabbud, and with them seuentie males.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I gathered them to the Riuer that goeth toward Ahaua, and there abode we three dayes: then I viewed the people, and the Priests, and found there none of the sonnes of Leui.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore sent I to Eliezer, to Ariel, to Shemeiah, and to Elnathan, and to Iarib, and to Elnathan, and to Nathan, and to Zechariah, and to Meshullam the chiefe, and to Ioiarib and to Elnathan, men of vnderstanding,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I gaue them commandement, to Iddo the chiefest at the place of Casiphia, and I told them the words that they should speake to Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims at the place of Casiphia, that they should cause the ministers of the house of our God to come vnto vs.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So by the good hande of our God which was vpon vs, they brought vs a man of vnderstanding of the sonnes of Mahali the sonne of Leui the sonne of Israel, and Sherebiah with his sonnes and his brethren, euen eighteene.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Also Hashabiah, and with him Ieshaiah of the sonnes of Merari, with his brethren, and their sonnes twentie.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And of the Nethinims, whom Dauid had set, and the Princes for the seruice of the Leuites, two hundreth and twentie of the Nethinims, which all were named by name.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And there at the Riuer, by Ahaua, I proclaimed a fast, that we might humble our selues before our God, and seeke of him a right way for vs, and for our children, and for all our substance.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For I was ashamed to require of the King an armie and horsemen, to helpe vs against the enemie in the way, because we had spoken to the King, saying, The hande of our God is vpon all them that seeke him in goodnesse, but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So we fasted, aud besought our God for this: and he was intreated of vs.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then I separated twelue of the chiefe of the Priests, Sherebiah, and Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And weighed them the siluer and the gold, and the vessels, euen the offring of ye house of our God, which the King and his counselers, and his Princes, and all Israel that were present had offred.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I weighed vnto their hand sixe hundreth and fiftie talents of siluer, and in siluer vessel, an hundreth talents, and in golde, an hundreth talents:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And twentie basins of golde, of a thousand drammes, and two vessels of shining brasse very good, and precious as golde.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I said vnto them, Ye are consecrate vnto the Lord, and the vessels are consecrate, and the gold and the siluer are freely offred vnto the Lord God of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Watch ye, and keepe them vntill ye weigh them before the chiefe Priestes and the Leuites, and the chiefe fathers of Israel in Ierusalem in the chambers of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So the Priests and the Leuites receiued the weight of the siluer and of the golde, and of the vessels to bring them to Ierusalem, vnto the house of our God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then we departed from the Riuer of Ahauah on the twelft day of the first moneth, to go vnto Ierusalem, and the hand of our God was vpon vs, and deliuered vs from the hand of the enemie, and of such as layde waite by the way.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And we came to Ierusalem, and abode there three dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And on ye fourth day was the siluer weighed, and the golde and the vessell in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the sonne of Vriah the Priest, and with him was Eleazar the sonne of Phinehas, and with them was Iozabad the sonne of Ieshua, and Noadiah the sonne of Binnui the Leuites,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>By number and by weight of euery one, and all the weight was written at the same time.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Also the children of the captiuitie, which were come out of captiuitie, offred burnt offrings vnto the God of Israel, twelue bullockes for all Israel, ninetie and sixe rammes, seuentie and seuen lambes, and twelue hee goates for sinne: all was a burnt offring of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they deliuered the Kings commission vnto the Kings officers, and to the captaines beyond the Riuer: and they promoted the people, and the house of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
