</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>THE ELDER to the elect Lady, and her children, whom I loue in the trueth: and not I onely, but also all that haue knowen the trueth,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For the trueths sake which dwelleth in vs, and shalbe with vs for euer:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace be with you, mercie and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ the Sonne of the Father, with trueth and loue.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I reioyced greatly, that I founde of thy children walking in trueth, as we haue receiued a commandement of the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And nowe beseeche I thee, Lady, (not as writing a newe commandement vnto thee, but that same which we had from the beginning) that we loue one another.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And this is that loue, that we should walke after his commandements. This commandement is, that as ye haue heard from the beginning, ye should walke in it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For many deceiuers are entred into this worlde, which confesse not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh. He that is such one, is a deceiuer and an Antichrist.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Looke to your selues, that we lose not the things which we haue done, but that we may receiue full reward.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whosoeuer transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If there come any vnto you, and bring not this doctrine, receiue him not to house, neither bid him, God speede:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he that biddeth him, God speede, is partaker of his euill deedes. Although I had many things to write vnto you, yet I woulde not write with paper and ynke: but I trust to come vnto you, and speake mouth to mouth, that our ioy may be full.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The sonnes of thine elect sister greete thee, Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
