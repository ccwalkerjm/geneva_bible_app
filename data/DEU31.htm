Ioshua, he shall goe before thee, as the Lord hath said.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the Lord shall doe vnto them, as he did to Sihon and to Og Kings of the Amorites: and vnto their lande whome he destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord shall giue them before you that ye may do vnto them according vnto euery commandement, which I haue comanded you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Plucke vp your hearts therefore, and be strong: dread not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God him selfe doeth goe with thee: he will not faile thee, nor forsake thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Moses called Ioshua, and said vnto him in the sight of all Israel, Be of a good courage and strong: for thou shalt go with this people vnto the lande which the Lord hath sworne vnto their fathers, to giue them, and thou shalt giue it them to inherite.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Lord him selfe doeth go before thee: he will be with thee: he will not faile thee, neither forsake thee: feare not therefore, nor be discomforted.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Moses wrote this Lawe, and deliuered it vnto the Priestes the sonnes of Leui (which bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lord) and vnto all the Elders of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Moses commanded them, saying, Euery seuenth yeere when the yeere of freedome shalbe in the feast of the Tabernacles:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When all Israel shall come to appeare before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall chuse, thou shalt reade this Lawe before all Israel that they may heare it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Gather the people together: men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may heare, and that they may learne, and feare the Lord your God, and keepe and obserue all the wordes of this Lawe,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And that their children which haue not knowen it, may heare it, and learne to feare the Lord your God, as long as ye liue in the lande, whither ye goe ouer Iorden to possesse it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the Lord saide vnto Moses, Beholde, thy dayes are come, that thou must die: Call Ioshua, and stande ye in the Tabernacle of the Congregation that I may giue him a charge. So Moses and Ioshua went, and stoode in the Tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle, in the pillar of a cloude: and the pillar of the cloude stoode ouer the doore of the Tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord said vnto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleepe with thy fathers, and this people will rise vp, and goe a whoring after the gods of a strange land (whither they goe to dwell therein) and will forsake me, and breake my couenant which I haue made with them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Wherefore my wrath will waxe hote against them at that day, and I will forsake them, and will hide my face from them: then they shalbe consumed, and many aduersities and tribulations shall come vpon them: so then they will say, Are not these troubles come vpon me, because God is not with me?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I will surely hide my face in that day, because of all the euill, which they shall commit, in that they are turned vnto other gods.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouthes, that this song may be my witnesse against the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For I will bring them into the land (which I sware vnto their fathers) that floweth with milke and honie, and they shall eate, and fil them selues, and waxe fat: then shall they turne vnto other gods, and serue them, and contemne me, and breake my couenant.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And then when many aduersities and tribulations shall come vpon them, this song shall answere them to their face as a witnesse: for it shall not be forgotte out of the mouthes of their posteritie: for I knowe their imagination, which they goe about euen now, before I haue brought them into the lande which I sware.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And God gaue Ioshua the sonne of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong, and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the lande, which I sware vnto them, and I will be with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when Moses had made an ende of writing the wordes of this Lawe in a booke vntill he had finished them,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Moses commanded the Leuites, which bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Take the booke of this Lawe, and put ye it in the side of the Arke of the couenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witnes against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For I knowe thy rebellion and thy stiffe necke: beholde, I being yet aliue with you this day, ye are rebellious against the Lord: howe much more then after my death?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Gather vnto me all the Elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speake these wordes in their audience, and call heauen and earth to recorde against them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For I am sure that after my death ye will vtterly be corrupt and turne from the way, which I haue commanded you: therefore euill will come vpon you at the length, because ye will comit euill in the sight of the Lord, by prouoking him to anger through the worke of your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thus Moses spake in the audience of all the congregation of Israel the wordes of this song, vntill he had ended them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
