Whosoeuer therefore will be a friend of the world, maketh himselfe the enemie of God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Doe ye thinke that the Scripture sayeth in vaine, The spirit that dwelleth in vs, lusteth after enuie?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But the Scripture offereth more grace, and therefore sayth, God resisteth the proude, and giueth grace to the humble.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Submit your selues to God: resist the deuill, and he will flee from you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Drawe neere to God, and he will drawe neere to you. Clense your handes, ye sinners, and purge your hearts, ye double minded.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Suffer afflictions, and sorrowe ye, and weepe: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your ioy into heauinesse.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cast downe your selues before the Lord, and he will lift you vp.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Speake not euill one of another, brethren. He that speaketh euill of his brother, or he that condemneth his brother, speaketh euill of ye Law, and condemneth the Lawe: and if thou condemnest the Lawe, thou art not an obseruer of the Lawe, but a iudge.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There is one Lawgiuer, which is able to saue, and to destroy. Who art thou that iudgest another man?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Goe to now ye that say, To day or to morowe we will goe into such a citie, and continue there a yeere, and bye and sell, and get gaine,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>(And yet ye cannot tell what shalbe to morowe. For what is your life? It is euen a vapour that appeareth for a litle time, and afterward vanisheth away)  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, and, if we liue, we will doe this or that.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But now ye reioyce in your boastings: all such reioycing is euill.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore, to him that knoweth how to doe well, and doeth it not, to him it is sinne. </div><ul class='tnav'>
