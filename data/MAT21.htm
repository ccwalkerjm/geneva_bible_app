And Iesus said vnto them, Yea: read ye neuer, By the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast made perfite the praise?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So hee left them, and went out of the citie vnto Bethania, and lodged there.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And in the morning, as he returned into the citie, he was hungrie,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And seeing a figge tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaues onely, and said to it, Neuer fruite grow on thee henceforwards. And anon the figge tree withered.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when his disciples saw it, they marueiled, saying, How soone is the figge tree withered!  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Iesus answered and said vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, if ye haue faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only doe that, which I haue done to the figge tree, but also if ye say vnto this mountaine, Take thy selfe away, and cast thy selfe into the sea, it shalbe done.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And whatsoeuer ye shall aske in prayer, if ye beleeue, ye shall receiue it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And whe he was come into the Temple, the chiefe Priestes, and the Elders of the people came vnto him, as he was teaching, and saide, By what authoritie doest thou these things? and who gaue thee this authoritie?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Iesus answered and said vnto them, I also will aske of you a certaine thing, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authoritie I doe these things.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The baptisme of Iohn, whence was it? from heauen, or of men? Then they reasoned among themselues, saying, If we shall say, From heauen, he will say vnto vs, Why did ye not then beleeue him?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And if we say, Of men, we feare the multitude, for all holde Iohn as a Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then they answered Iesus, and said, We can not tell. And he said vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But what thinke ye? A certaine man had two sonnes, and came to the elder, and saide, Sonne, goe and worke to day in my vineyarde.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But he answered, and said, I will not: yet afterward he repented himselfe, and went.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then came he to the second, and said likewise. And he answered, and said, I will, Syr: yet he went not.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Whether of them twaine did the will of the father? They saide vnto him, The first. Iesus saide vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, that the Publicanes and the harlots goe before you into the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For Iohn came vnto you in the way of righteousnes, and yee beleeued him not: but the Publicanes, and the harlots beleeued him, and ye, though ye sawe it, were not mooued with repentance afterward, that ye might beleeue him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Heare another parable, There was a certaine housholder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and made a winepresse therein, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a strange countrey.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And when the time of the fruite drewe neere, hee sent his seruants to the husbandmen to receiue the fruites thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And ye husbandmen tooke his seruants and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Againe hee sent other seruants, moe then the first: and they did the like vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But last of all he sent vnto them his owne sonne, saying, They will reuerence my sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But when the husbandmen saw the sonne, they saide among themselues, This is the heire: come, let vs kill him, and let vs take his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>So they tooke him, and cast him out of the vineyarde, and slewe him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>When therefore the Lord of the vineyarde shall come, what will hee doe to those husbandmen?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>They saide vnto him, Hee will cruelly destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard vnto other husbandmen, which shall deliuer him the fruites in their seasons.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Iesus saide vnto them, Read ye neuer in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders refused, the same is made the head of the corner? This was the Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Therefore say I vnto you, The kingdome of God shalbe taken from you, and shalbe giuen to a nation, which shall bring foorth the fruites thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And whosoeuer shall fall on this stone, he shalbe broken: but on whomsoeuer it shall fall, it will dash him a pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And when the chiefe Priestes and Pharises had heard his parables, they perceiued that hee spake of them.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And they seeking to laye handes on him, feared the people, because they tooke him as a Prophet. </div><ul class='tnav'>
