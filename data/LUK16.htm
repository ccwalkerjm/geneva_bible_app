<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he sayde also vnto his disciples, There was a certaine riche man, which had a stewarde, and he was accused vnto him, that he wasted his goods.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And hee called him, and saide vnto him, Howe is it that I heare this of thee? Giue an accounts of thy stewardship: for thou maiest be no longer steward.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then the stewarde saide within himselfe, What shall I doe? for my master taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot digge, and to begge I am ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I knowe what I will doe, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receiue mee into their houses.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then called he vnto him euery one of his masters detters, and said vnto the first, Howe much owest thou vnto my master?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he said, An hudreth measures of oyle. And he saide to him, Take thy writing, and sitte downe quickely, and write fiftie.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And hee sayde, An hundreth measures of wheate. Then he saide to him, Take thy writing, and write foure score.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Lord commended the vniust stewarde, because he had done wisely. Wherefore the children of this worlde are in their generation wiser then the children of light.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I say vnto you, Make you friends with the riches of iniquitie, that when ye shall want, they may receiue you into euerlasting habitations.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He that is faithfull in the least, hee is also faithful in much: and he that is vniust in the least, is vniust also in much.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If then ye haue not ben faithful in the wicked riches, who wil trust you in the true treasure?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if ye haue not bene faithfull in another mans goods, who shall giue you that which is yours?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>No seruaunt can serue two masters: for either he shall hate the one, and loue the other: or els he shall leane to the one, and despise the other. Yee can not serue God and riches.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>All these thinges heard the Pharises also which were couetous, and they scoffed at him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then he sayde vnto them, Yee are they, which iustifie your selues before men: but God knoweth your heartes: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The Lawe and the Prophets endured vntill Iohn: and since that time the kingdome of God is preached, and euery man preasseth into it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Nowe it is more easie that heauen and earth shoulde passe away, then that one title of the Lawe should fall.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whosoeuer putteth away his wife, and marieth another, committeth adulterie: and whosoeuer marieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adulterie.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There was a certaine riche man, which was clothed in purple and fine linnen, and fared well and delicately euery day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Also there was a certaine begger named Lazarus, which was laide at his gate full of sores,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And desired to bee refreshed with the crommes that fell from the riche mans table: yea, and the dogges came and licked his sores.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it was so that the begger died, and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome. The rich man also died, and was buried.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And being in hell in torments, he lift vp his eyes, and sawe Abraham a farre off, and Lazarus in his bosome.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then he cried, and saide, Father Abraham, haue mercie on mee, and sende Lazarus that hee may dippe the tip of his finger in water, and coole my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Abraham saide, Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleasures, and likewise Lazarus paines: now therefore is he comforted, and thou art tormented.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Besides all this, betweene you and vs there is a great gulfe set, so that they which would goe from hence to you, can not: neither can they come from thence to vs.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then he said, I pray thee therfore, father, that thou wouldest sende him to my fathers house,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>(For I haue fiue brethren) that he may testifie vnto them, least they also come into this place of torment.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Abraham said vnto him, They haue Moses and the Prophets: let them heare them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he sayde, Nay, father Abraham: but if one came vnto them from the dead, they will amend their liues.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then he saide vnto him, If they heare not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rise from the dead againe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
