hast thou gathered thy multitude to take a booty? to cary away siluer and golde, to take away cattell and goods, and to spoyle a great pray?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore, sonne of man, prophecie, and saye vnto Gog, Thus sayeth the Lord God, In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safe, shalt thou not knowe it?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And come from thy place out of the North partes, thou and much people with thee? all shall ride vpon horses, euen a great multitude and a mightie armie.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou shalt come vp against my people of Israel, as a cloude to couer the land: thou shalt be in the latter dayes, and I will bring thee vpon my lande, that the heathen may knowe mee, when I shalbe sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God, Art not thou he, of whom I haue spoken in olde time, by ye hand of my seruants the Prophets of Israel which prophecied in those dayes and yeeres, that I woulde bring thee vpon them?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>At the same time also whe Gog shall come against the land of Israel, sayth the Lord God, my wrath shall arise in mine anger.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For in mine indignation and in the fire of my wrath haue I spoken it: surely at that time there shalbe a great shaking in the land of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So that the fishes of the sea, and the foules of the heauen, and the beasts of the field and al that moue and creepe vpon the earth, and al ye men that are vpon the earth, shall tremble at my presence, and the mountaines shalbe ouerthrowen, and the staires shall fall, and euery wall shall fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For I will call for a sworde against him throughout all my mountaines, saith the Lord God: euery mans sword shalbe against his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will pleade against him with pestilence, and with blood, and I will cause to raine vpon him and vpon his bands, and vpon the great people, that are with him, a sore raine, and hailestones, fire, and brimstone.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thus will I be magnified, and sanctified, and knowen in the eyes of many nations, and they shall knowe, that I am the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
