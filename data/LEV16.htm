<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Fvrthermore the Lord spake vnto Moses, after the death of the two sonnes of Aaron, whe they came to offer before the Lord, and dyed:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Speake vnto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the Holy place within the vayle, before the Merciseate, which is vpon the Arke, that he dye not: for I wil appeare in the cloude vpon the Merciseate.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>After this sort shall Aaron come into the Holy place: euen with a yong bullocke for a sinne offring, and a ramme for a burnt offring.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He shall put on the holy linnen coate, and shall haue linnen breeches vpon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linnen girdle, and shall couer his head with a linnen miter: these are the holy garments: therefore shall hee wash his flesh in water, when he doeth put them on.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And hee shall take of the Congregation of the children of Israel, two hee goates for a sinne offring, and a ramme for a burnt offring.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Aaron shall offer the bullocke for his sinne offring, and make an atonement for himselfe, and for his house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he shall take the two hee goates, and present them before the Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Aaron shall cast lots ouer the two hee goates: one lot for the Lord, and the other for the Scape goate.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Aaron shall offer the goat, vpon which the Lords lot shall fal, and make him a sinne offring.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the goate, on which the lot shall fall to be the Scape goate, shalbe presented aliue before the Lord, to make reconciliation by him, and to let him go (as a Scape goate) into the wildernes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus Aaron shall offer the bullocke for his sinne offring, and make a reconciliation for himselfe, and for his house, and shall kill the bullocke for his sinne offring.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he shall take a censer full of burning coles from off the altar before the Lord, and his handfull of sweete incense beaten small, and bring it within the vayle,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And shall put the incense vpon the fire before the Lord, that the cloude of the incense may couer the Merciseat that is vpon the Testimonie: so he shall not dye.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And hee shall take of the blood of the bullocke, and sprinkle it with his finger vpon the Merciseat Eastward: and before the Merciseate shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seuen times.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then shall he kill the goate that is the peoples sinne offring, and bring his blood within the vaile, and doe with that blood, as he did with the blood of the bullocke, and sprinckle it vpon the Merciseate, and before the Merciseate.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So he shall purge the Holy place from the vncleannes of the children of Israel, and from their trespasses of all their sinnes: so shall he do also for the Tabernacle of the Cogregation placed with them, in the middes of their vncleannesse.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And there shalbe no man in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, when he goeth in to make an atonement in the Holy place, vntill hee come out, and haue made an atonement for himselfe, and for his housholde, and for all the Congregation of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>After, he shall goe out vnto the altar that is before the Lord and make a reconciliation vpon it, and shall take of the blood of the bullocke, and of the blood of the goate, and put it vpon the hornes of the Altar round about:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So shall hee sprinkle of the blood vpon it with his finger seuen times, and clense it, and halowe it from the vncleannes of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When he hath made an ende of purging the Holy place, and the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the altar, then he shall bring the liue goate:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Aaron shall put both his handes vpon the head of the liue goate, and confesse ouer him al the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their trespasses, in all their sinnes, putting them vpon the head of the goate, and shall sende him away (by the hand of a man appointed) into the wildernes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the goate shall beare vpon him all their iniquities into the land that is not inhabited, and he shall let the goate go into the wildernesse.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>After, Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and put off the linnen clothes, which he put on when he went into the Holy place, and leaue them there.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Hee shall wash also his flesh with water in the Holy place, and put on his owne rayment, and come out, and make his burnt offring, and the burnt offring of the people, and make an atonement for himselfe, and for the people.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Also the fatte of the sinne offring shall he burne vpon the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he that caried forth the goat, called the Scape goat, shall wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in water, and after that shall come into the hoste.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Also the bullocke for the sinne offring, and the goate for the sinne offring (whose blood was brought to make a reconciliation in the Holy place) shall one carie out without the hoste to be burnt in the fire, with their skinnes, and with their flesh, and with their doung.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And hee that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in water, and afterward come into the hoste.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So this shalbe an ordinance for euer vnto you: the tenth day of the seuenth moneth, yee shall humble your soules, and do no worke at all, whether it be one of the same countrey or a strager that soiourneth among you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For that day shall ye Priest make an atonement for you to clense you: ye shalbe cleane from all your sinnes before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>This shall be a Sabbath of rest vnto you, and ye shall humble your soules, by an ordinance for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the Priest whom he shall anoynt, and whom he shall cosecrate (to minister in his fathers steade) shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linnen clothes and Holy vestments,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And shall purge the Holy Sanctuarie and the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall clense the altar, and make an atonement for the Priests and for all the people of the Congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And this shalbe an euerlasting ordinance vnto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sinnes once a yeere: and as the Lord commanded Moses, he did. </div><ul class='tnav'>
