And euery shipmaster, and all the people that occupie shippes, and shipmen, and whosoeuer traffike on the sea, shall stand a farre off,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And crie, when they see that smoke of that her burning, saying, What citie was like vnto this great citie?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they shall cast dust on their heads, and crie, weeping, and wayling, and say, Alas, alas, that great citie, wherein were made rich all that had ships on the sea by her costlinesse: for in one houre she is made desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O heauen, reioyce of her, and ye holy Apostles and Prophets: for God hath punished her to be reuenged on her for your sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then a mightie Angell tooke vp a stone like a great milstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, With such violence shall that great citie Babylon be cast, and shalbe found no more.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the voyce of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpetters shalbe heard no more in thee, and no craftesman, of whatsoeuer craft he be, shall be found any more in thee: and the sound of a milstone shalbe heard no more in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the light of a candle shall shine no more in thee: and the voyce of the bridegrome and of the bride shalbe heard no more in thee: for thy marchants were the great men of the earth: and with thine inchantments were deceiued all nations.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And in her was found the blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were slaine vpon the earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
