And they smote him with their roddes.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then Pilate went foorth againe, and said vnto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may knowe, that I finde no fault in him at all.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then came Iesus foorth wearing a crowne of thornes, and a purple garment. And Pilate said vnto them, Beholde the man.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then when the hie Priests and officers sawe him, they cried, saying, Crucifie, crucifie him. Pilate said vnto them, Take yee him and crucifie him: for I finde no fault in him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Iewes answered him, We haue a lawe, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himselfe the Sonne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When Pilate then heard that woorde, he was the more afraide,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And went againe into the common hall, and saide vnto Iesus, Whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him none answere.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then saide Pilate vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to loose thee?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were giuen thee from aboue: therefore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the greater sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>From thence foorth Pilate sought to loose him, but the Iewes cried, saying, If thou deliuer him, thou art not Cesars friende: for whosoeuer maketh himselfe a King, speaketh against Cesar.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When Pilate heard this woorde, hee brought Iesus foorth, and sate downe in the iudgement seate in a place called the Pauement, and in Hebrewe, Gabbatha.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it was the Preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and hee sayde vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But they cried, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate sayde vnto them, Shall I crucifie your King? The high Priestes answered, We haue no King but Cesar.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then deliuered he him vnto them, to be crucified. And they tooke Iesus, and led him away.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he bare his owne crosse, and came into a place named of dead mens Skulles, which is called in Hebrewe, Golgotha:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Iesus in the middes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Pilate wrote also a title, and put it on the crosse, and it was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWES.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This title then read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified, was neere to the citie: and it was written in Hebrewe, Greeke and Latine.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then saide the hie Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Iewes, but that he sayd, I am King of the Iewes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Pilate answered, What I haue written, I haue written.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then the souldiers, when they had crucified Iesus, tooke his garments (and made foure partes, to euery souldier a part) and his coat: and the coat was without seame wouen from the toppe throughout.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore they sayde one to another, Let vs not deuide it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. This was that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which sayth, They parted my garments among them, and on my coate did cast lots. So the souldiers did these things in deede.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then stoode by the crosse of Iesus his mother, and his mothers sister, Marie the wife of Cleopas, and Marie Magdalene.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when Iesus sawe his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loued, he said vnto his mother, Woman, beholde thy sonne.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then saide he to the disciple, Beholde thy mother: and from that houre, the disciple tooke her home vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>After, when Iesus knew that all things were performed, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, he said, I thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And there was set a vessell full of vineger: and they filled a spondge with vineger: and put it about an Hyssope stalke, and put it to his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Nowe when Iesus had receiued of the vineger, he saide, It is finished, and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Iewes then (because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remaine vpon the crosse on the Sabbath day: for that Sabbath was an hie day) besought Pilate that their legges might be broken, and that they might be taken downe.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then came the souldiers and brake the legges of the first, and of the other, which was crucified with Iesus.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But when they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead alreadie, they brake not his legges.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But one of the souldiers with a speare pearced his side, and foorthwith came there out blood and water.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he that sawe it, bare recorde, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might beleeue it.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For these things were done, that the Scripture shoulde be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shalbe broken.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And againe an other Scripture saith, They shall see him whom they haue thrust through.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And after these things, Ioseph of Arimathea (who was a disciple of Iesus, but secretly for feare of the Iewes) besought Pilate that he might take downe the bodie of Iesus. And Pilate gaue him licence. He came then and tooke Iesus body.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And there came also Nicodemus (which first came to Iesus by night) and brought of myrrhe and aloes mingled together about an hundreth pound.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then tooke they the body of Iesus, and wrapped it in linnen clothes with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burie.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And in that place where Iesus was crucified, was a garden, and in the garden a newe sepulchre, wherein was neuer man yet laid.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>There then laide they Iesus, because of the Iewes Preparation day, for the sepulchre was neere. </div><ul class='tnav'>
