Loe, certeinly in vaine made hee it, the penne of the scribes is in vaine.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The wise men are ashamed: they are afraid and taken. loe, they haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what wisdome is in them?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore will I giue their wiues vnto others, and their fieldes to them that shall possesse them: for euery one from the least euen vnto the greatest is giuen to couetousnesse, and from the Prophet euen vnto the Priest, euery one dealeth falsely.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For they haue healed the hurt of the daughter of my people with sweete woordes, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not ashamed, neither coulde they haue any shame: therefore shall they fall among the slaine: when I shall visite them, they shall be cast downe, sayeth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I wil surely consume them, sayth the Lord: there shalbe no grapes on the vine, nor figges on the figtree, and the leafe shall fade, and the things that I haue giuen them, shall depart from them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Why doe we stay? assemble your selues, and let vs enter into the strong cities, and let vs be quiet there: for the Lord our God hath put vs to silence and giuen vs water with gall to drinke, because we haue sinned against the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>We looked for peace, but no good came, and for a time of health, and behold troubles.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The neying of his horses was heard from Dan, the whole lande trembled at the noyse of the neying of his strong horses: for they are come, and haue deuoured the land with all that is in it, the citie, and those that dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For beholde, I will sende serpents, and cockatrices among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall sting you, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I would haue comforted my selfe against sorowe, but mine heart is heauie in me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people for feare of them of a farre countrey, Is not the Lord in Zion? is not her king in her? Why haue they prouoked mee to anger with their grauen images, and with the vanities of a strange god?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The haruest is past, the sommer is ended, and we are not holpen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I am sore vexed for the hurt of ye daughter of my people: I am heauie, and astonishment hath taken me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Is there no balme at Gilead? is there no Physition there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recouered. </div><ul class='tnav'>
