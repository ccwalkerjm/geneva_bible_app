tenth day of the moneth, in the fourteenth yeere after that the citie was smitten, in the selfe same day, the hande of the Lord was vpon mee, and brought me thither.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Into the lande of Israel brought he me by a diuine vision, and set me vpon a very hie mountaine, whereupon was as the building of a citie, toward the South.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he brought me thither, and beholde, there was a man, whose similitude was to looke to, like brasse, with a linnen thread in his hand, and a reede to measure with: and he stoode at the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the man said vnto me, Sonne of man, beholde with thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, and set thine heart vpon all that I shall shew thee: for to the intent, that they might be shewed thee, art thou brought hither: declare al that thou seest, vnto the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And beholde, I sawe a wall on the outside of the house round about: and in the mans hand was a reede to measure with, of sixe cubites long, by the cubite, and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the buylding with one reede, and the height with one reede.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then came he vnto the gate, which looketh towarde the East, and went vp the stayres thereof, and measured the poste of the gate, which was one reede broade, and the other poste of the gate, which was one reede broade.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And euery chamber was one reede long, and one reede broad, and betweene the chambers were fiue cubites: and the post of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reede.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He measured also the porche of the gate within with one reede.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then measured he the porch of the gate of eight cubites, and the postes thereof, of two cubites, and the porch of the gate was inward.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the chambers of the gate Eastwarde, were three on this side, and three on that side: they three were of one measure, and the postes had one measure on this side, and one on that side.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he measured the breadth of the entrie of the gate ten cubites, and the height of the gate thirteene cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The space also before the chambers was one cubite on this side, and the space was one cubite on that side, and the chambers were sixe cubites on this side and sixe cubites on that side.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He measured then the gate from the roufe of a chamber to the toppe of the gate: the breadth was fiue and twentie cubites, doore against doore.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He made also postes of threescore cubites, and the postes of the court, and of the gate had one measure round about.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And vpon the forefront of the entry of the gate vnto the forefront of the porch of the gate within were fiftie cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And there were narrowe windowes in the chambers, and in their postes within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and the windowes went rounde about within: and vpon the postes were palme trees.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then brought he me into the outwarde court, and lo, there were chambers, and a pauement made for the court round about, and thirtie chambers were vpon the pauement.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the pauement was by the side of the gates ouer against the length of the gates, and the pauement was beneath.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then hee measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate without, vnto the forefront of the court within, an hundreth cubits Eastward and Northward.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the gate of the outwarde court, that looked toward the North, measured he after the length and breadth thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the chambers thereof were, three on this side, and three on that side, and the postes thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fiftie cubites, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And their windowes, and their arches with their palme trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the East, and the going vp vnto it had seuen steppes, and the arches therof were before them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the gate of the inner court stoode ouer against the gate towarde the North, and towarde the East, and hee measured from gate to gate an hundreth cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>After that, he brought mee towarde the South, and loe, there was a gate towarde the South, and hee measured the postes thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there were windowes in it, and in the arches thereof round about, like those windowes: the height was fiftie cubites, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And there were seuen steps to go vp to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palme trees, one on this side, and another on that side vpon the post thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there was a gate in the inner court towarde the South, and he measured from gate to gate towarde the South an hundreth cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he brought me into the inner court by the South gate, and he measured the South gate according to these measures,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the chambers thereof, and the postes thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures, and there were windowes in it, and in the arches thereof rounde about, it was fiftie cubites long and fiue and twentie cubites broade.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the arches round about were fiue and twenty cubites long, and fiue cubites broad.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the arches thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof, and the going vp to it had eight steppes.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Againe he brought me into ye inner court toward the East, and he measured the gate according to these measures.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the chambers thereof, and the postes thereof, and the arches thereof were according to these measures, and there were windowes therein, and in the arches thereof round about, it was fiftie cubites long, and fiue and twentie cubites broade.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the arches thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof, on this side and on that side, and the going vp to it had eight steppes.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>After he brought mee to the North gate, and measured it, according to these measures,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The chambers thereof, the postes thereof, and the arches thereof, and there were windowes therein round about: the height was fiftie cubits, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the postes thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof on this side, and on that side, and the going vp to it had eight steps.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And euery chamber, and the entrie thereof was vnder the postes of the gates: there they washed the burnt offring.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And in the porch of the gate stoode two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, vpon the which they slew the burnt offring, and the sinne offring, and the trespas offring.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And at the side beyond the steppes, at the entry of the North gate stoode two tables, and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate were two tables.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Foure tables were on this side, and foure tables on that side by the side of the gate, euen eight tables whereupon they slew their sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And the foure tables were of hewen stone for the burnt offering, of a cubite and an halfe long, and a cubite and an halfe broade, and one cubite hie: whereupon also they layde the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offring and the sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And within were borders an hand broade, fastened round about, and vpon the tables lay the flesh of the offring.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And without the inner gate were ye chambers of the singers in the inner Court, which was at the side of the North gate: and their prospect was towarde the South, and one was at the side of the East gate, hauing the prospect towarde the North.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he said vnto me, This chamber whose prospect is towarde the South, is for the Priestes that haue the charge to keepe the house.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And the chamber whose prospect is toward the North, is for the Priestes that haue the charge to keepe the altar: these are the sonnes of Zadok among ye sonnes of Leui which may
