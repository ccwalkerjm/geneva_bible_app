<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 44</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then he brought me towarde the gate of the outwarde Sanctuarie, which turneth towarde the East, and it was shut.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then saide the Lord vnto me, This gate shalbe shut, and shall not bee opened, and no man shall enter by it, because the Lord God of Israel hath entred by it, and it shalbe shut.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>It appertaineth to the Prince: the Prince himselfe shall sit in it to eate bread before the Lord: he shall enter by the way of the porche of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then brought he mee toward the North gate before the House: and when I looked, beholde, the glorie of the Lord filled the house of the Lord, and I fell vpon my face.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord sayd vnto me, Sonne of man, marke well, and behold with thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, all that I say vnto thee, concerning al the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and al the lawes thereof, and marke well the entring in of the house with euery going forth of the Sanctuarie,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And thou shalt say to the rebellious, euen to ye house of Israel, Thus saith ye Lord God, O house of Israel, ye haue ynough of al your abominations,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Seeing that yee haue brought into my Sanctuarie strangers, vncircumcised in heart, and vncircumcised in flesh, to bee in my Sanctuarie, to pollute mine house, when yee offer my bread, euen fat, and blood: and they haue broken my couenant, because of all your abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For yee haue not kept the ordinances of mine holy things: but you your selues haue set other to take the charge of my Sanctuarie.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thus saieth the Lord God, No stranger vncircumcised in heart, nor vncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my Sanctuarie, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Neither yet ye Leuites that are gone backe from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray from thee after their idoles, but they shall beare their iniquitie.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they shall serue in my Sanctuarie, and keepe the gates of the House, and minister in the House: they shall slay the burnt offring and the sacrifice for the people: and they shall stand before them to serue them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Because they serued before their idoles, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquitie, therfore haue I lift vp mine had against the, saith the Lord God, and they shall beare their iniquity,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they shall not come neere vnto me to do ye office of ye Priest vnto me, neyther shall they come neere vnto any of mine holy things in the most holy place, but they shall beare their shame and their abominations, which they haue comitted.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will make them keepers of ye watch of the House, for all the seruice thereof, and for all that shalbe done therein.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But the Priests of the Leuites, the sonnes of Zadok, that kept the charge of my Sanctuarie, when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come neere to me to serue me, and they shall stande before me to offer me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They shall enter into my Sanctuarie, and shall come neere to my table, to serue me, and they shall keepe my charge.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And whe they shall enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments, and no wool shall come vpon the while they serue in ye gates of the inner court, and within.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They shall haue linnen bonets vpon their heades, and shall haue linnen breeches vpon their loynes: they shall not girde them selues in the sweating places.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But when they goe foorth into the vtter court, euen to the vtter court to the people, they shall put off their garments, wherein they ministred, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments: for they shall not sanctifie the people with their garments.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They shall not also shaue their heades, nor suffer their lockes to growe long, but rounde their heades.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Neither shall any Priest drinke wine when they enter into the inner court.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Neither shall they take for their wiues a widowe, or her that is diuorced: but they shall take maidens of the seede of the house of Israel, or a widow that hath bene the widow of a Priest.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they shall teach my people the difference betweene the holy and prophane, and cause them to discerne betweene the vncleane and the cleane.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And in controuersie they shall stande to iudge, and they shall iudge it according to my iudgements: and they shall keepe my lawes and my statutes in all mine assemblies, and they shall sanctifie my Sabbaths.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they shall come at no dead person to defile theselues, except at their father, or mother, or sone, or daughter, brother or sister, that hath had yet none husband: in these may they be defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when he is clensed, they shall reckon vnto him seuen dayes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when he goeth into ye Sanctuarie vnto the inner court to minister in the Sanctuarie, he shall offer his sinne offring, saith ye Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the Priesthood shall bee their inheritance, yea, I am their inheritance: therefore shall ye giue them no possessio in Israel, for I am their possession.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They shall eate the meat offring, and the sinne offring, and the trespas offring, and euery dedicate thing in Israel shall be theirs.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And all the first of all the first borne, and euery oblation, euen all of euery sort of your oblations shall be the Priestes. Ye shall also giue vnto the Priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Priests shall not eate of any thing, that is dead, or torne, whether it be foule or beast. </div><ul class='tnav'>
