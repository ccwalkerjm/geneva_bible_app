But they held their peace.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then hee looked rounde about on them angerly, mourning also for the hardnesse of their hearts, and saide to the man, Stretch foorth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hande was restored, as whole as the other.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Pharises departed, and straightway gathered a councill with the Herodians against him, that they might destroy him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But Iesus auoided with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude followed him from Galile, and from Iudea,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And from Ierusalem, and from Idumea, and beyonde Iordan: and they that dwelled about Tyrus and Sidon, when they had heard what great things he did, came vnto him in great number.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he commanded his disciples, that a litle shippe should waite for him, because of the multitude, lest they shoulde throng him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For hee had healed many, in so much that they preassed vpon him to touch him, as many as had plagues.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when the vncleane spirits sawe him, they fel downe before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Sonne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he sharply rebuked them, to the ende they should not vtter him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then hee went vp into a mountaine, and called vnto him whome he woulde, and they came vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And hee appoynted twelue that they should be with him, and that he might send them to preache,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And that they might haue power to heale sicknesses, and to cast out deuils.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the first was Simon, and hee named Simon, Peter,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Iames the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iohn Iames brother (and surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sonnes of thunder,)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Andrew, and Philippe, and Bartlemew, and Matthewe, and Thomas, and Iames, the sonne of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananite,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Iudas Iscariot, who also betraied him, and they came home.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the multitude assembled againe, so that they could not so much as eate bread.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when his kinsfolkes heard of it, they went out to laie hold on him: for they sayde that he was beside himselfe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Scribes which came downe from Hierusalem, saide, He hath Beelzebub, and through the prince of the deuils he casteth out deuils.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he called them vnto him, and said vnto them in parables, How can Satan driue out Satan?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For if a kingdome bee deuided against it selfe, that kingdome can not stand.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Or if a house bee deuided against it selfe, that house can not continue.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So if Satan make insurrection against himselfe, and be deuided, hee can not endure but is at an ende.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>No man can enter into a strong mans house, and take away his goods, except hee first binde that strong man, and then spoyle his house.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Verely I say vnto you, all sinnes shalbe forgiuen vnto the children of men, and blasphemies, wherewith they blaspheme:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But hee that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost, shall neuer haue forgiuenesse, but is culpable of eternall damnation.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Because they saide, Hee had an vncleane spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then came his brethren and mother, and stoode without, and sent vnto him, and called him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the people sate about him, and they said vnto him, Beholde, thy mother, and thy brethren seeke for thee without.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But hee answered them, saying, Who is my mother and my brethren?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And hee looked rounde about on them, which sate in compasse about him, and saide, Beholde my mother and my brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For whosoeuer doeth the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother. </div><ul class='tnav'>
