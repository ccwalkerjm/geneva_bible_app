<div class='mt'>THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul and Timotheus the seruants of IESVS CHRIST, to all the Saintes in Christ Iesus which are at Philippi, with the Bishops, and Deacons:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I thanke my God, hauing you in perfect memorie,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>(Alwayes in all my praiers for all you, praying with gladnesse)  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Because of the fellowship which ye haue in the Gospel, from the first day vnto nowe.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I am persuaded of this same thing, that he that hath begunne this good worke in you, wil perfourme it vntill the day of Iesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>As it becommeth me so to iudge of you all, because I haue you in remembrance that both in my bands, and in my defence, and confirmation of the Gospell you all were partakers of my grace.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For God is my recorde, howe I long after you all from the very heart roote in Iesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And this I pray, that your loue may abound, yet more and more in knowledge, and in all iudgement,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>That ye may alowe those things which are best, that ye may be pure, and without offence vntill the day of Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Filled with the fruites of righteousnesse, which are by Iesus Christ vnto the glorie and praise of God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I would ye vnderstood, brethren, that the things which haue come vnto me, are turned rather to the furthering of the Gospell,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So that my bandes in Christ are famous throughout all the iudgement hall, and in all other places,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In so much that many of the brethren in the Lord are boldened through my bandes, and dare more frankely speake the word.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Some preache. Christ euen through enuie and strife, and some also of good will.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The one part preacheth Christ of contention and not purely, supposing to adde more affliction to my bandes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the others of loue, knowing that I am set for the defence of the Gospell.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>What then? yet Christ is preached all maner wayes, whether it be vnder a pretence, or syncerely: and I therein ioye: yea and will ioye.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I knowe that this shall turne to my saluation through your prayer, and by the helpe of the Spirit of Iesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As I feruently looke for, and hope, that in nothing I shalbe ashamed, but that with all confidence, as alwayes, so nowe Christ shalbe magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For Christ is to me both in life, and in death aduantage.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And whether to liue in the flesh were profitable for me, and what to chuse I knowe not.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I am distressed betweene both, desiring to be loosed and to be with Christ, which is best of all.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse, to abide in the flesh, is more needefull for you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And this am I sure of, that I shall abide, and with you all continue, for your furtherance and ioy of your faith,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>That ye may more aboundantly reioyce in IESVS CHRIST for me, by my comming to you againe.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Onely let your conuersation be, as it becommeth the Gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or els be absent, I may heare of your matters that ye continue in one Spirit, and in one mind, fighting together through the faith of the Gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And in nothing feare your aduersaries, which is to them a token of perdition, and to you of saluation, and that of God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For vnto you it is giuen for Christ, that not onely ye should beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Hauing the same fight, which ye sawe in me, and nowe heare to be in me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
