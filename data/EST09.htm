and what is thy petition, that it may be giuen thee? or what is thy request moreouer, that it may be performed?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then sayd Ester, If it please the King, let it be granted also to morow to the Iewes that are in Shushan, to do according vnto this daies decree, that they may hang vpon ye tree Hamans ten sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the King charged to doe so, and the decree was giuen at Shushan, and they hanged Hamans ten sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the Iewes that were in Shushan, assembled themselues vpon the fourteenth day of the moneth Adar, and slew three hundreth men in Shushan, but on the spoyle they layd not their hand.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the rest of the Iewes that were in the Kings prouinces assembled themselues, and stood for their liues, and had rest from their enemies, and slewe of them that hated them, seuentie and fiue thousand: but they layd not their hand on the spoyle.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This they did on the thirteenth day of the moneth Adar, and rested the fourteenth day thereof, and kept it a day of feasting and ioy.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the Iewes that were in Shushan assembled themselues on the thirteenth day, and on the fourteenth therof, and they rested on the fifteenth of the same, and kept it a day of feasting and ioy.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore the Iewes of the villages that dwelt in the vnwalled townes, kept the foureteenth day of the moneth Adar with ioy and feasting, euen a ioyfull day, and euery one sent presents vnto his neighbour.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Mordecai wrote these words, and sent letters vnto all the Iewes that were through all the prouinces of the King Ahashuerosh, both neere and farre,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Inioyning them that they shoulde keepe the fourteenth day of the moneth Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, euery yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>According to the dayes wherein the Iewes rested from their enemies, and the moneth which was turned vnto them from sorowe to ioy, and from mourning into a ioyfull day, to keepe them the dayes of feasting, and ioy, and to sende presents euery man to his neyghbour, and giftes to the poore.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Iewes promised to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written vnto them,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Because Haman the sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite al the Iewes aduersarie, had imagined against the Iewes, to destroy them, and had cast Pur (that is a lot) to consume and destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when she came before the King, he commanded by letters, Let this wicked deuise (which he imagined against the Iewes) turne vpon his owne head, and let them hang him and his sonnes on the tree.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therfore they called these dayes Purim, by the name of Pur, and because of all the wordes of this letter, and of that which they had seene besides this, and of that which had come vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The Iewes also ordeined, and promised for them and for their seede, and for all that ioyned vnto them, that they would not faile to obserue those two dayes euery yeere, according to their writing, and according to their season,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And that these dayes shoulde be remembred, and kept throughout euery generation and euery familie, and euery prouince, and euery citie: euen these daies of Purim should not faile among the Iewes, and the memoriall of them should not perish from their seede.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the Queene Ester ye daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Iew wrote with al authoritie (to cofirme this letter of Purim ye second time)  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he sent letters vnto al the Iewes to the hundreth and seuen and twentie prouinces of the kingdome of Ahashuerosh, with words of peace and trueth,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>To confirme these dayes of Purim, according to their seasons, as Mordecai the Iewe and Ester the Queene had appointed them, and as they had promised for them selues and for their seede with fasting and prayer.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the decree of Ester confirmed these words of Purim, and was written in the booke. </div><ul class='tnav'>
