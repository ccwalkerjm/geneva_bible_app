<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the twelft yeere of Ahaz King of Iudah began Hoshea the sonne of Elah to reigne in Samaria ouer Israel, and reigned nine yeeres.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he did euill in the sight of the Lord, but not as the Kinges of Israel, that were before him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Shalmaneser king of Asshur came vp against him, and Hoshea became his seruant, and gaue him presents.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the King of Asshur founde treason in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So King of Egypt, and brought no present vnto the King of Asshur, as he had done yeerely: therfore the king of Asshur shut him vp, and put him in prison.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the king of Asshur came vp throughout all the lande, and went against Samaria, and besieged it three yeere.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the ninth yeere of Hoshea, the King of Asshur tooke Samaria, and caryed Israel away vnto Asshur, and put them in Halah, and in Habor by the riuer of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For when the children of Israel sinned against the Lord their God, which had brought them out of the land of Egypt, from vnder ye hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and feared other gods,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And walked according to the facions of the Heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel, and after the maners of the Kings of Israel, which they vsed,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the children of Israel had done secretly things that were not vpright before the Lord their God, and throughout all their cities had built hie places, both from the tower of the watch, to the defensed citie,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And had made them images and groues vpon euery hie hill, and vnder euery greene tree,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And there burnt incense in all the hie places, as did the heathen, whom the Lord had taken away before them, and wrought wicked things to anger the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And serued idoles: whereof the Lord had sayd vnto them, Ye shall do no such thing,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Notwithstanding the Lord testified to Israel, and to Iudah by all the Prophets, and by all the Seers, saying, Turne from your euill wayes, and keepe my commandements and my statutes, according to all the Lawe, which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my seruants the Prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse they would not obey, but hardened their neckes, like to the neckes of their fathers, that did not beleeue in the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they refused his statutes and his couenant, that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies (wherewith he witnessed vnto them) and they followed vanitie, and became vaine, and followed the heathen that were round about them: concerning whome the Lord had charged them, that they should not do like them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Finally they left all the commandements of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, euen two calues, and made a groue, and worshipped all the hoste of heauen, and serued Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they made their sonnes and their daughters passe thorowe the fire, and vsed witchcraft and inchantments, yea, solde them selues to doe euill in the sight of the Lord, to anger him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord was exceeding wroth with Israel, and put them out of his sight, and none was left but the tribe of Iudah onely.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet Iudah kept not the commandements of the Lord their God, but walked according to the facion of Israel, which they vsed.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord cast off all the seede of Israel, and afflicted them, and deliuered them into the handes of spoylers, vntill he had cast them out of his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For he cut off Israel from the house of Dauid, and they made Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat King: and Ieroboam drewe Israel away from following the Lord, and made them sinne a great sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the children of Israel walked in all the sinnes of Ieroboam, which he did, and departed not therefrom,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Vntill the Lord put Israel away out of his sight, as he had said by all his seruants the Prophets, and caryed Israel away out of their land to Asshur vnto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the King of Asshur brought folke from Babel, and from Cuthah, and from Aua, and from Hamath, and from Sepharuaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria in steade of the children of Israel: so they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they feared not the Lord: therefore the Lord sent lions among them, which slewe them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Wherefore they spake to the King of Asshur, saying, The nations which thou hast remoued, and placed in the cities of Samaria, knowe not the maner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they knowe not the maner of the God of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the King of Asshur commanded, saying, Carie thither one of the Priestes whome ye brought thence, and let him goe and dwell there, and teache them the maner of the God of the countrey.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So one of the Priestes, which they had caryed from Samaria, came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they shoulde feare the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Howbeit euery nation made their gods, and put them in the houses of the hie places, which the Samaritanes had made, euery nation in their cities, wherein they dwelt.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For the men of Babel made Succoth-Benoth: and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Auims made Nibhaz, and Tartak: and the Sepharuims burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech, and Anammelech the gods of Sepharuaim.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thus they feared the Lord, and appoynted out Priestes out of them selues for the hie places, who prepared for them sacrifices in the houses of the hie places.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They feared the Lord, but serued their gods after the maner of the nations whome they caryed thence.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Vnto this day they doe after the olde maner: they neyther feare God, neyther doe after their ordinances, nor after their customes, nor after the Lawe, nor after the commandement, which the Lord commanded the children of Iaakob, whom he named Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And with whom the Lord had made a couenant, and charged them, saying, Feare none other gods, nor bowe your selues to them, nor serue them, nor sacrifice to them:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But feare the Lord which brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power, and a stretched out arme: him feare ye, and worshippe him, and sacrifice to him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Also keepe ye diligently the statutes and the ordinances, and the Lawe, and the commandement, which he wrote for you, that ye do them continually, and feare not other gods.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And forget not the couenant that I haue made with you, neither feare ye other gods,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But feare the Lord your God, and he will deliuer you out of the handes of all your enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Howbeit they obeyed not, but did after their olde custome.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>So these nations feared the Lord, and serued their images also: so did their children, and their childrens children: as did their fathers, so do they vnto this day. </div><ul class='tnav'>
