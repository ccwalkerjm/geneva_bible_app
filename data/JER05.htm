Shall not my soule be auenged on such a nation as this?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Clime vp vpon their walles, and destroy them, but make not a full ende: take away their batilments, for they are not the Lords.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the house of Israel, and the house of Iudah haue grieuously trespassed against me, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They haue denied the Lord, and saide, It is not he, neither shall the plague come vpon vs, neither shall we see sworde nor famine.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Prophetes shall be as winde, and the worde is not in them: thus shall it come vnto them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hostes, Because ye speake such wordes, beholde, I will put my wordes into thy mouth, like a fire, and this people shall be as wood, and it shall deuoure them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Loe, I will bring a nation vpon you from farre, O house of Israel, saith the Lord, which is a mightie nation, and an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither vnderstandest what they say.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Whose quiuer is as an open sepulchre: they are all very strong.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they shall eate thine haruest and thy bread: they shall deuoure thy sonnes and thy daughters: they shall eate vp thy sheepe and thy bullocks: they shall eate thy vines and thy figge trees: they shall destroy with the sworde thy fenced cities, wherein thou didest trust.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse at those dayes, sayth the Lord, I will not make a full ende of you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the Lord our God doe these things vnto vs? then shalt thou answere them, Like as ye haue forsaken me and serued strange gods in your land, so shall ye serue strangers in a land that is not yours.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Declare this in the house of Iaakob, and publish it in Iudah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Heare nowe this, O foolish people, and without vnderstanding, which haue eyes and see not, which haue eares and heare not.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Feare ye not me, saith the Lord? or will ye not be afraide at my presence, which haue placed the sand for the bounds of the sea by the perpetuall decree that it cannot passe it, and though the waues thereof rage, yet can they not preuaile, though they roare, yet can they not passe ouer it?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But this people hath an vnfaithfull and rebellious heart: they are departed and gone.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For they say not in their heart, Let vs nowe feare the Lord our God, that giueth raine both early and late in due season: hee reserueth vnto vs the appointed weekes of the haruest.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Yet your iniquities haue turned away these things, and your sinnes haue hindred good things from you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For among my people are founde wicked persons, that lay waite as hee that setteth snares: they haue made a pit, to catch men.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As a cage is full of birdes, so are their houses full of deceite: thereby they are become great and waxen riche.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They are waxen fat and shining: they doe ouerpasse the deedes of the wicked: they execute no iudgement, no not the iudgement of the fatherlesse: yet they prosper, though they execute no iudgement for the poore.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Shall I not visite for these things, sayth the Lord? or shall not my soule be auenged on such a nation as this?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>An horrible and filthie thing is committed in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Prophets prophesie lies, and ye Priests receiue giftes in their handes, and my people delite therein. What will ye then doe in the ende thereof? </div><ul class='tnav'>
