<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 51</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Thus sayth the Lord, Beholde, I wil raise vp against Babel, and against the inhabitants that lift vp their heart against me, a destroying wind,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And wil send vnto Babel fanners that shall fanne her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shalbe against her on euery side.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Also to the bender that bendeth his bowe, and to him that lifteth himselfe vp in his brigandine, will I say, Spare not her yong men, but destroy all her hoste.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Thus the slaine shall fall in the lande of the Caldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streetes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For Israel hath bene no widowe, nor Iudah from his God, from the Lord of hostes, though their lande was filled with sinne against the holy one of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Flee out of the middes of Babel, and deliuer euery man his soule: be not destroyed in her iniquitie: for this is the time of the Lordes vengeance he will render vnto her a recompence.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Babel hath bene as a golden cuppe in the Lordes hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations haue drunken of her wine, therefore do the nations rage.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Babel is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howle for her, bring balme for her sore, if she may be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>We would haue cured Babel, but she could not be healed: forsake her, and let vs go euery one into his owne countrey: for her iudgement is come vp vnto heauen, and is lifted vp to ye cloudes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Lord hath brought forth our righteousnesse: come and let vs declare in Zion the worke of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Make bright the arrowes: gather the shieldes: the Lord hath raised vp the spirit of the King of the Medes: for his purpose is against Babel to destroy it, because it is the vengeance of the Lord, and the vengeance of his Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Set vp the standart vpon the walles of Babel, make the watch strong: set vp the watchmen: prepare the skoutes: for the Lord hath both deuised, and done that which he spake against the inhabitantes of Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O thou that dwellest vpon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine ende is come, euen the ende of thy couetousnes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Lord of hostes hath sworne by him selfe, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers, and they shall cry and shoute against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He hath made the earth by his power, and established the world by his wisedome, and hath stretched out the heauen by his discretion.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Hee giueth by his voyce the multitude of waters in the heauen, and he causeth the cloudes to ascend from the endes of the earth: he turneth lightnings to raine, and bringeth forth the winde out of his treasures.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Euery man is a beast by his owne knowledge: euery founder is confounded by the grauen image: for his melting is but falsehood, and there is no breath therein.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They are vanitie, and the worke of errours: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The portion of Iaakob is not like them: for he is the maker of all things, and Israel is the rodde of his inheritance: the Lord of hostes is his Name.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou art mine hammer, and weapons of warre: for with thee will I breake the nations, and with thee wil I destroy kingdomes,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And by thee wil I breake horse and horseman, and by thee will I breake the charet and him that rideth therein.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>By thee also will I breake man and woman, and by thee wil I breake olde and yong, and by thee wil I breake the yong man and the mayde.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I wil also breake by thee the shepheard and his flocke, and by thee will I breake the husband man and his yoke of oxen, and by thee will I breake the dukes and princes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I will render vnto Babel, and to all the inhabitants of the Caldeans all their euil, that they haue done in Zion, euen in your sight, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Beholde, I come vnto thee, O destroying mountaine, sayth the Lord, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand vpon thee, and rolle thee downe from the rockes, and wil make thee a burnt mountaine.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations, but thou shalt be destroyed for euer, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Set vp a standard in the lande: blowe the trumpets among the nations: prepare the nations against her: call vp the kingdomes of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz against her: appoynt the prince against her: cause horses to come vp as the rough caterpillers.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Prepare against her the nations with the Kings of the Medes, the dukes thereof, and the princes thereof, and all the land of his dominion.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the land shall tremble and sorow: for the deuise of the Lord shalbe performed against Babel, to make the lande of Babel waste without an inhabitant.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The strong men of Babel haue ceased to fight: they haue remayned in their holdes: their strength hath fayled, and they were like women: they haue burnt her dwelling places, and her barres are broken.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>A post shall runne to meete the post, and a messenger to meete the messenger, to shew the King of Babel, that his citie is taken on a side thereof,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And that the passages are stopped, and the reedes burnt with fire, and the me of war troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For thus sayth the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, the daughter of Babel is like a threshing floore: the time of her threshing is come: yet a litle while, and the time of her haruest shall come.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Nebuchad-nezzar the King of Babel hath deuoured me, and destroyed me: he hath made me an emptie vessel: he swallowed mee vp like a dragon, and filled his belly with my delicates, and hath cast me out.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The spoyle of me, and that which was left of me, is brought vnto Babel, shall the inhabitant of Zion say: and my blood vnto the inhabitantes of Caldea, shall Ierusalem say.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Therefore thus sayth the Lord, Beholde, I will maintayne thy cause, and take vengeance for thee, and I will drie vp the sea, and drie vp her springes.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Babel shall be as heapes, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>They shall rore together like lions, and yell as the lyons whelpes.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>In their heate I will make them feastes, and I wil make them drunken, that they may reioyce, and sleepe a perpetual sleepe, and not wake, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>I wil bring them downe like lambes to the slaughter, and like rams and goates.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>How is Sheshach taken! and howe is the glory of the whole earth taken! how is Babel become an astonishment among the nations!  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The sea is come vp vpon Babel: he is couered with the multitude of the waues thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Her cities are desolate: the land is dry and a wildernes, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth the sonne of man passe thereby.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>I wil also visite Bel in Babel, and I wil bring out of his mouth, that which he hath swallowed vp, and the nations shall runne no more vnto him, and the wall of Babel shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>My people, go out of the middes of her, and deliuer yee euery man his soule from the fierce wrath of the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Least your heart euen faynt, and ye feare the rumour, that shalbe heard in the land: the rumour shall come this yeere, and after that in the other yeere shall come a rumour, and crueltie in the land, and ruler against ruler.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Therefore beholde, the dayes come, that I will visite the images of Babel, and the whole land shalbe confounded, and all her slayne shall fall in the middes of her.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Then the heauen and the earth, and all that is therein, shall reioyce for Babel: for the destroyers shall come vnto her from the North, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>As Babel caused the slaine of Israel to fal, so by Babel the slaine of all the earth did fall.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Ye that haue escaped the sworde, goe away, stand not still: remember the Lord a farre of, and let Ierusalem come into your minde.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Wee are confounded because wee haue heard reproch: shame hath couered our faces, for straungers are come into the Sanctuaries of the Lordes House.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Wherefore behold, the dayes come, sayth the Lord, that I will visite her grauen images, and through all her land the wounded shall grone.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Though Babel should mount vp to heauen, and though shee should defend her strength on hye, yet from mee shall her destroyers come, sayth the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>A sound of a cry commeth from Babel, and great destruction from the land of the Caldeans,  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Because the Lord hath layde Babel waste and destroyed from her the great voyce, and her waues shall roare like great waters, and a sounde was made by their noyse:  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Because the destroyer is come vpon her, euen vpon Babel, and her strong men are taken, their bowes are broken: for the Lord God that recompenceth, shall surely recompence.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And I will make drunke her princes, and her wise men, her dukes, and her nobles, and her strong men: and they shall sleepe a perpetuall sleepe, and not wake, sayth the King, whose Name is the Lord of hostes.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord of hostes, The thicke wall of Babel shalbe broken, and her hie gates shall be burnt with fire, and the people shall labour in vaine, and the folke in ye fire, for they shalbe weary.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>The worde which Ieremiah the Prophet commanded Sheraiah the sonne of Neriiah, the sonne of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the King of Iudah into Babel, in the fourth yeere of his reigne: and this Sheraiah was a peaceable prince.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>So Ieremiah wrote in a booke all the euill that should come vpon Babel: euen al these things, that are written against Babel.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And Ieremiah sayd to Sheraiah, Whe thou commest vnto Babel, and shalt see, and shalt reade all these wordes,  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Then shalt thou say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to destroy it, that none should remaine in it, neither man nor beast, but that it should be desolate for euer.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And when thou hast made an ende of reading this booke, thou shalt binde a stone to it, and cast it in the middes of Euphrates,  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>And shalt say, Thus shall Babel be drowned, and shall not rise from the euil, that I will bring vpon her: and they shall be weary. Thus farre are the wordes of Ieremiah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
