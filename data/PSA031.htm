In thee, O Lord, haue I put my trust: let mee neuer be confounded: deliuer me in thy righteousnesse.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Bowe downe thine eare to me: make haste to deliuer mee: be vnto me a stronge rocke, and an house of defence to saue me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For thou art my rocke and my fortresse: therefore for thy Names sake direct mee and guide me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Drawe mee out of the nette, that they haue layde priuilie for mee: for thou art my strength.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Into thine hand I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of trueth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I haue hated them that giue them selues to deceitfull vanities: for I trust in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I wil be glad and reioyce in thy mercie: for thou hast seene my trouble: thou hast knowen my soule in aduersities,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And thou hast not shut me vp in the hand of the enemie, but hast set my feete at large.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Haue mercie vpon mee, O Lord: for I am in trouble: mine eye, my soule and my bellie are consumed with griefe.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For my life is wasted with heauinesse, and my yeeres with mourning: my strength faileth for my paine, and my bones are consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I was a reproch among all mine enemies, but specially among my neighbours: and a feare to mine acquaintance, who seeing me in the streete, fled from me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I am forgotten, as a dead man out of minde: I am like a broken vessell.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For I haue heard the rayling of great men: feare was on euery side, while they conspired together against mee, and consulted to take my life.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I trusted in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My times are in thine hande: deliuer mee from the hande of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Make thy face to shine vpon thy seruant, and saue me through thy mercie.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let me not be confounded, O Lord: for I haue called vpon thee: let the wicked bee put to confusion, and to silence in the graue.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let the lying lips be made dumme, which cruelly, proudly and spitefully speake against the righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Howe great is thy goodnesse, which thou hast layde vp for them, that feare thee! and done to them, that trust in thee, euen before the sonnes of men!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou doest hide them priuily in thy presence from the pride of men: thou keepest them secretly in thy Tabernacle from the strife of tongues.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord: for hee hath shewed his marueilous kindenesse toward me in a strong citie.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Though I said in mine haste, I am cast out of thy sight, yet thou heardest the voyce of my prayer, when I cryed vnto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Loue ye the Lord all his Saintes: for the Lord preserueth the faithfull, and rewardeth abundantly the proud doer.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>All ye that trust in the Lord, be strong, and he shall establish your heart. </div><ul class='tnav'>
