The Lord hath called me from the wombe, and made mention of my name from my mothers bellie.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And hee hath made my mouth like a sharpe sworde: vnder the shadowe of his hande hath he hid mee, and made me a chosen shafte, and hid me in his quiuer,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And sayd vnto me, Thou art my seruaunt, Israel, for I will be glorious in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And I said, I haue labored in vaine: I haue spent my strength in vaine and for nothing: but my iudgement is with the Lord, and my woorke with my God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And now sayeth the Lord, that formed me from the wombe to be his seruaunt, that I may bring Iaakob againe to him (though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I bee glorious in the eyes of the Lord: and my God shall be my strength)  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And hee sayde, It is a small thing that thou shouldest be my seruaunt, to raise vp the tribes of Iaakob, and to restore the desolations of Israel: I will also giue thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou maiest bee my saluation vnto the ende of the worlde.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord the redeemer of Israel, and his Holie one, to him that is despised in soule, to a nation that is abhorred, to a seruaunt of rulers, Kinges shall see, and arise, and princes shall worship, because of the Lord, that is faithfull: and ye Holy one of Israel, which hath chosen thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord, In an acceptable time haue I heard thee, and in a day of saluation haue I helped thee: and I will preserue thee, and wil giue thee for a couenant of ye people, that thou maiest raise vp the earth, and obtaine the inheritance of the desolate heritages:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>That thou maiest say to the prisoners, Goe foorth: and to them that are in darkenesse, Shewe your selues: they shall feede in the waies, and their pastures shall bee in all the toppes of the hilles.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They shall not be hungrie, neither shall they be thirstie, neither shall the heat smite them, nor the sunne: for he that hath compassion on them, shall leade them: euen to the springs of waters shall he driue them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I will make all my mountaines, as a way, and my paths shalbe exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Beholde, these shall come from farre: and loe, these from the North and from the West, and these from the land of Sinim.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Reioyce, O heauens: and bee ioyfull, O earth: brast foorth into praise, O mountaines: for God hath comforted his people, and will haue mercie vpon his afflicted.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Zion saide, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Can a woman forget her childe, and not haue compassion on the sonne of her wombe? though they should forget, yet wil I not forget thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Behold, I haue grauen thee vpon the palme of mine hands: thy walles are euer in my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thy builders make haste: thy destroiers and they that made thee waste, are departed from thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Lift vp thine eies round about and behold: all these gather themselues together and come to thee: as I liue, sayeth the Lord, thou shalt surely put them all vpon thee as a garment, and girde thy selfe with them like a bride.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For thy desolations, and thy waste places, and thy land destroied, shall surely be now narow for them that shall dwell in it, and they that did deuoure thee, shalbe farre away.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The children of thy barennesse shall say againe in thine eares, The place is straict for mee: giue place to me that I may dwell.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten mee these, seeing I am baren and desolate, a captiue and a wanderer to and from? and who hath nourished them? beholde, I was left alone: whence are these?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus sayeth the Lord God, Beholde, I will lift vp mine hande to the Gentiles and set vp my stadart to the people, and they shall bring thy sonnes in their armes: and thy daughters shall be caried vpon their shoulders.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Kings shalbe thy nourcing fathers, and Queenes shalbe thy nources: they shall worship thee with their faces towarde the earth, and licke vp the dust of thy feete: and thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord: for they shall not be ashamed that waite for me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Shall the pray be taken from the mightie? or the iust captiuitie deliuered?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But thus sayeth the Lord, euen the captiuitie of the mightie shall be taken away: and the pray of the tyrant shall be deliuered: for I wil contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will saue thy children,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And will feede them that spoile thee, with their owne flesh, and they shall be drunken with their owne bloode, as with sweete wine: and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy sauiour and thy redeemer, the mighty one of Iaakob. </div><ul class='tnav'>
