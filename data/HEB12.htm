<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Wherefore, let vs also, seeing that we are compassed with so great a cloude of witnesses, cast away euery thing that presseth downe, and the sinne that hangeth so fast on: let vs runne with patience the race that is set before vs,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Looking vnto Iesus the authour and finisher of our faith, who for the ioy that was set before him, endured the crosse, and despised the shame, and is set at the right hand of the throne of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Consider therefore him that endured such speaking against of sinners, lest ye should be wearied and faint in your mindes.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Ye haue not yet resisted vnto blood, striuing against sinne.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And ye haue forgotten the consolation, which speaketh vnto you as vnto children, My sonne, despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For whom the Lord loueth, he chasteneth: and he scourgeth euery sonne that he receiueth:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If ye endure chastening, God offereth him selfe vnto you as vnto sonnes: for what sonne is it whom the father chasteneth not?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If therefore ye be without correction, whereof al are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sonnes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Moreouer we haue had the fathers of our bodies which corrected vs, and we gaue them reuerence: should we not much rather be in subiection vnto the father of spirites, that we might liue?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For they verely for a few dayes chastened vs after their owne pleasure: but he chasteneth vs for our profite, that we might be partakers of his holinesse.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now no chastising for the present seemeth to be ioyous, but, grieuous: but afterwarde, it bringeth the quiet fruite of righteousnesse, vnto them which are thereby exercised.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wherfore lift vp your hands which hang downe, and your weake knees,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And make straight steppes vnto your feete, lest that which is halting, be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Followe peace with all men, and holinesse, without the which no man shall see ye Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Take heede, that no man fall away from the grace of God: let no roote of bitternes spring vp and trouble you, lest thereby many be defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let there be no fornicator, or prophane person as Esau, which for one portion of meate solde his birthright.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For ye knowe howe that afterwarde also when he woulde haue inherited the blessing, he was reiected: for he founde no place to repentance, though he sought that blessing with teares.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For ye are not come vnto the mount that might be touched, nor vnto burning fire, nor to blacknes and darkenes, and tempest,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Neither vnto the sounde of a trumpet, and the voyce of wordes, which they that heard it, excused themselues, that the word should not be spoken to them any more,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>(For they were not able to abide that which was commanded, yea, though a beast touche the mountaine, it shalbe stoned, or thrust through with a dart:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And so terrible was the sight which appeared, that Moses said, I feare and quake.)  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But ye are come vnto the mount Sion, and to the citie of the liuing God, the celestiall Hierusalem, and to ye company of innumerable Angels,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And to the assemblie and congregation of the first borne, which are written in heauen, and to God the iudge of all, and to the spirits of iust and perfite men,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And to Iesus the Mediatour of the new Testament, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things then that of Abel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>See that ye despise not him that speaketh: for if they escaped not which refused him, that spake on earth: much more shall we not escape, if we turne away from him, that speaketh from heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Whose voyce then shooke the earth and nowe hath declared, saying, Yet once more will I shake, not the earth onely, but also heauen.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And this worde, Yet once more, signifieth the remouing of those things which are shaken, as of things which are made with hands, that the things which are not shaken, may remaine.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Wherefore seeing we receiue a kingdome, which cannot be shaken, let vs haue grace whereby we may so serue God, that we may please him with reuerence and feare.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For euen our God is a consuming fire. </div><ul class='tnav'>
