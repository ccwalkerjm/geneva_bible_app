And he said vnto them,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Striue to enter in at the straite gate: for many, I say vnto you, will seeke to enter in, and shall not be able.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When the good man of the house is risen vp, and hath shut to the doore, and ye begin to stand without, and to knocke at the doore, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs, and he shall answere and say vnto you, I know you not whence ye are,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then shall ye begin to say, We haue eaten and drunke in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streetes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But he shall say, I tell you, I knowe you not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquitie.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac, and Iacob, and all the Prophets in the kingdome of God, and your selues thrust out at doores.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then shall come many from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from the South, and shall sit at Table in the kingdome of God.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And beholde, there are last, which shalbe first, and there are first, which shalbe last.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The same day there came certaine Pharises, and said vnto him, Depart, and goe hence: for Herod will kill thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then said he vnto them, Goe ye and tell that foxe, Beholde, I cast out deuils, and will heale still to day, and to morowe, and the third day I shalbe perfected.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Neuerthelesse I must walke to day, and to morowe, and the day following: for it cannot be that a Prophet should perish out of Hierusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>O Hierusalem, Hierusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee, howe often would I haue gathered thy children together, as the henne gathereth her brood vnder her wings, and ye would not!  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Beholde, your house is left vnto you desolate: and verely I tell you, ye shall not see me vntill the time come that ye shall say, Blessed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
