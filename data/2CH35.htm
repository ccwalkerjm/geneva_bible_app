I come not against thee this day, but against the house of mine enemie, and God commanded me to make haste: leaue of to come against God, which is with me, least he destroy thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But Iosiah would not turne his face from him, but changed his apparel to fight with him, and hearkened not vnto the wordes of Necho, which were of the mouth of God, but came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the shooters shot at king Iosiah: then the King saide to his seruants, Cary me away, for I am very sicke.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So his seruants tooke him out of that charet, and put him in the seconde charet which he had, and when they had brought him to Ierusalem, he dyed, and was buryed in the sepulchres of his fathers: and all Iudah and Ierusalem mourned for Iosiah.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Ieremiah lamented Iosiah, and al singing men and singing women mourned for Iosiah in their lamentations to this day, and made the same for an ordinance vnto Israel: and beholde, they be written in the lamentations.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Concerning the rest of the actes of Iosiah and his goodnesse, doing as it was written in the Lawe of the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And his deedes, first and last, behold, they are written in the booke of the Kings of Israel and Iudah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
