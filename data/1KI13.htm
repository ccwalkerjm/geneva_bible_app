And the man of God besought the Lord, and the Kings hand was restored, and became as it was afore.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then the King sayde vnto the man of God, Come home with mee, that thou mayest dyne, and I will giue thee a reward.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the man of God saide vnto the King, If thou wouldest giue me halfe thine house, I would not goe in with thee, neither woulde I eate bread nor drinke water in this place.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For so was it charged mee by the worde of the Lord, saying, Eate no bread nor drinke water, nor turne againe by the same way that thou camest.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And an olde Prophet dwelt in Beth-el, and his sonnes came and tolde him all ye woorkes, that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el, and the wordes which he had spoken vnto the King, tolde they their father.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And their father sayde vnto them, What way went he? and his sonnes shewed him what waye the man of God went, which came from Iudah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And hee saide vnto his sonnes, Saddle mee the asse. Who sadled him the asse, and hee rode thereon,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And went after the man of God, and found him sitting vnder an oke: and he saide vnto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Iudah? And he sayd, Yea.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then he said vnto him, Come home with me, and eate bread.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But he answered, I may not returne with thee, nor go in with thee, neither wil I eate bread nor drinke water with thee in this place.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For it was charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Thou shalt eate no bread, nor drinke water there, nor turne againe to goe by the way that thou wentest.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said vnto him, I am a Prophet also as thou art, and an Angel spake vnto me by the worde of the Lord, saying, Bring him againe with thee into thine house, that hee may eate bread and drinke water: but he lyed vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So he went againe with him, and did eate bread in his house, and dranke water.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And as they sate at the table, the worde of the Lord came vnto the Prophet, that brought him againe.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And hee cried vnto the man of God that came from Iudah, saying, Thus sayeth the Lord, Because thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandement which the Lord thy God commanded thee,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But camest backe againe, and hast eaten bread and drunke water in the place (whereof he did say vnto thee, Thou shalt eate no bread nor drinke any water) thy carkeis shall not come vnto the sepulchre of thy fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when he had eaten bread and drunke, he sadled him the asse, to wit, to the Prophet whome he had brought againe.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when hee was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slewe him, and his body was cast in the way, and the asse stoode thereby: the lion stood by the corps also.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And beholde, men that passed by, sawe the carkeis cast in the way, and the lion standing by the corps: and they came and tolde it in ye towne where the olde Prophet dwelt.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when the Prophet that brought him backe againe from the waye, hearde thereof, hee sayde, It is the man of God, who hath bene disobedient vnto the commandement of the Lord: therefore the Lord hath deliuered him vnto the lion, which hath rent him and slayne him, according to the worde of the Lord, which hee spake vnto him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he spake to his sonnes, saying, Saddle me the asse. And they sadled him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he went and founde his body cast in the way, and the asse and the lion stoode by the corps: and the lion had not eaten the bodie, nor torne the asse.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the Prophet tooke vp the body of the man of God, and layed it vpon the asse, and brought it againe, and the olde Prophet came to the citie, to lament and burie him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And hee layed his bodie in his owne graue, and they lamented ouer him, saying, Alas, my brother.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when he had buried him, hee spake to his sonnes, saying, When I am dead, burie ye mee also in the sepulchre, wherein the man of God is buried: lay my bones beside his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For that thing which he cried by the word of the Lord against the altar that is in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the hie places, which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to passe.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Howbeit after this, Ieroboam conuerted not from his wicked way, but turned againe, and made of the lowest of the people Priests of the hie places. Who would, might consecrate him selfe, and be of the Priestes of the hie places.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And this thing turned to sinne vnto the house of Ieroboam, euen to roote it out, and destroy it from the face of the earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
