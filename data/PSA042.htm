As the harte brayeth for the riuers of water, so panteth my soule after thee, O God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>My soule thirsteth for God, euen for the liuing God: when shall I come and appeare before the presence of God?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>My teares haue bin my meate day and night, while they dayly say vnto me, Where is thy God?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When I remembred these things, I powred out my very heart, because I had gone with the multitude, and ledde them into the House of God with the voyce of singing, and prayse, as a multitude that keepeth a feast.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Why art thou cast downe, my soule, and vnquiet within me? waite on God: for I will yet giue him thankes for the helpe of his presence.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>My God, my soule is cast downe within me, because I remember thee, from the land of Iorden, and Hermonim, and from the mount Mizar.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>One deepe calleth another deepe by the noyse of thy water spoutes: all thy waues and thy floods are gone ouer me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord will graunt his louing kindenesse in the day, and in the night shall I sing of him, euen a prayer vnto the God of my life.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I wil say vnto God, which is my rocke, Why hast thou forgotten mee? why goe I mourning, when the enemie oppresseth me?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My bones are cut asunder, while mine enemies reproch me, saying dayly vnto me, Where is thy God?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Why art thou cast downe, my soule? and why art thou disquieted within mee? waite on God: for I wil yet giue him thankes: he is my present helpe, and my God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
