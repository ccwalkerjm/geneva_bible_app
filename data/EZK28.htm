but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hands of him that slayeth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou shalt die the death of the vncircumcised by the hands of stragers: for I haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Sonne of man, take vp a lamentation vpon the King of Tyrus, and say vnto him, Thus sayeth the Lord God, Thou sealest vp the summe, and art full of wisedome and perfite in beautie.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou hast ben in Eden the garden of God: euery precious stone was in thy garment, the rubie, the topaze and the diamonde, the chrysolite, the onix, and the iasper, the saphir, emeraude, and the carbuncle and golde: the woorkemanship of thy timbrels, and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou art the anointed Cherub, that couereth, and I haue set thee in honour: thou wast vpon the holy mountaine of God: thou hast walked in the middes of the stones of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou wast perfite in thy wayes from the day that thou wast created, till iniquitie was found in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>By the multitude of thy marchandise, they haue filled the middes of thee with crueltie, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as prophane out of the mountaine of God: and I will destroy thee, O couering Cherub from the mids of the stones of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thine heart was lifted vp because of thy beautie, and thou hast corrupted thy wisedome by reason of thy brightnes: I wil cast thee to ye grounde: I will lay thee before Kinges that they may beholde thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou hast defiled thy sanctification by the multitude of thine iniquities, and by the iniquitie of thy marchandise: therefore wil I bring forth a fire from the mids of thee, which shall deuoure thee: and I wil bring thee to ashes vpon the earth, in the sight of all them that beholde thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All they that knowe thee among the people, shalbe astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terrour, and neuer shalt thou be any more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Againe, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Sonne of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesie against it,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And say, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I come against thee, O Zidon, and I will be glorified in the mids of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall haue executed iudgements in her, and shalbe sanctified in her.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I wil send into her pestilence, and blood into her streetes, and the slaine shall fall in the middes of her: the enemie shall come against her with the sword on euery side, and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they shalbe no more a pricking thorne vnto the house of Israel, nor any grieuous thorne of all that are round about them, and despised them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God, When I shall haue gathered the house of Israel from the people where they are scattered, and shalbe sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwel in the land, that I haue giuen to my seruant Iaakob.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall builde houses, and plant vineyards: yea, they shall dwell safely, when I haue executed iudgements vpon al round about them that despise them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord their God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
