# Geneva Bible App
This is a simple Bible App based on the Geneva Version. It uses the new Progessive Web App Standard so that it can easily work on any device whether Android, IoS or any Desktop or Laptop.  It must run on any Browser that supports PWA including Chrome and Firefox.

Geneva Bible was translated in 1590 so the English is very outdated. Nevertheless it is still an excellent Bible.  To make the Bible more adaptable we make it possible to switch between Old English and Modern Emglish and Between Sacred Names and Standard English Names. The user can easily switch to any mode. We use a programmable method for the switching.  The original Genvea Data is unchanged.  

Users can contribute freely. As you read the Bible you can suggest words that can be modernized. You are also free to upload your json dictionary with new conversions.  Once we are satified we will commit the changes.  

I decided to the proejct because I wanted a fairly pure English version.  You can read more about the Geneva from Wikpedia and other sources.
